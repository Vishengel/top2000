0,1,Bohemian Rhapsody,Queen,1975,"Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see

I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

Mama, ooh, (Any way the wind blows) I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me

Galileo (Galileo), Galileo (Galileo)
Galileo, Figaro, Magnifico, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah, no, we will not let you go (Let him go)
Bismillah, we will not let you go (Let him go)
Bismillah, we will not let you go (Let me go)
Never let you go (Let me go)
Never let you go (Never, never, never let me go, oh, oh, oh)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia
Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside
For me, for me, for me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh baby, can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right out of here

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-yeah, ooh-yeah

Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters, nothing really matters to me

Any way the wind blows"
1,2,Hotel California,Eagles,1977,"On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
""This could be heaven or this could be hell""
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine!""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969""
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, ""We are all just prisoners here of our own device""
And in their masters' chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
""Relax"", said the night man
""We are programmed to receive
You can checkout any time you like
But you can never leave"""
2,3,Piano Man,Billy Joel,1974,"It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
Making love to his tonic and gin

He says, ""Son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet, and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes""

La, la, la, de, de, da
La, la, de, de, da, da, da

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling all right

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be

He says, ""Bill, I believe this is killing me""
As the smile ran away from his face
""Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place""

Oh, la, la, la, de, de, da
La, la, de, de, da, da, da

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talking with Davy, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life

And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinking alone

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling all right

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see
To forget about life for a while

And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, ""Man, what are you doing here?""

Oh, la, la, la, de, de, da
La, la, de, de, da, da, dum

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling all right"
3,4,Stairway To Heaven,Led Zeppelin,1971,"There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there, she knows if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for

And she's buying a stairway to Heaven

There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

It makes me wonder
It makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

It makes me wonder
It really makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May Queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

And it makes me wonder

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind, oh

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadow's taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all, yeah
To be a rock and not to roll

And she's buying a stairway to Heaven"
4,5,Wish You Were Here,Pink Floyd,1975,"So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl year after year
Running over the same old ground, what have we found?
The same old fears
Wish you were here"
5,6,Child In Time,Deep Purple,1970,"Sweet child in time
You'll see the line
The line that's drawn between

6,7,Black,Pearl Jam,1992,"Hey
Hey yeah uh

Sheets of empty canvas
Untouched sheets of clay
Were laid spread out before me
As her body once did

Oh, all five horizons
Revolved around her soul
As the Earth to the sun
Now the air I've tasted and breathed
Has taken a turn

Ooh oh, and all I taught her was
Everything
Ooh oh, I know she gave me all that she wore

And now my bitter hands
Chafe beneath the clouds
Of what was everything
Oh, the pictures have
All been washed in black
Tattooed everything

I take a walk outside
I'm surrounded by some kids at play, yeah
I can feel their laughter
So why do I sear?

Ooh oh, and twisted thoughts that spin
'Round my head
I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning
How quick the sun can
Drop away

And now my bitter hands
Cradle broken glass
Of what was everything
All the pictures have
All been washed in black
Tattooed everything

All the love gone bad
Turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see, all that I am
All I'll be, yeah

Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Woo

I know someday you'll have a beautiful life
I know you'll be a star
In somebody else's sky
But why, why, why can't it be
Can't it be mine?

7,8,Africa,Toto,1982,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation

I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
We're gonna take some time to do the things we never have
Ooh ooh

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
We're gonna take some time to do the things we never have
Ooh ooh

Hurry, boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)

I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa (I'm gonna take some time)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have
Ooh ooh"
8,9,Fix You,Coldplay,2005,"When you try your best but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I...

Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I...

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you"
9,10,Avond,Boudewijn De Groot,1997,"Nu hoef je nooit je jas meer aan te trekken
En te hopen dat je licht het doet
Laat buiten de stormwind nu maar razen in het donker
Want binnen is het warm en licht en goed

Hand in hand naar buiten kijken waar de regen valt
Ik zie het vuur van hoop en twijfel in je ogen
En ik ken je diepste angst

Want je kunt niets zeker weten en alles gaat voorbij
Maar ik geloof, ik geloof, ik geloof, ik geloof, ik geloof in jou en mij

En als je 's morgens opstaat ben ik bij je
En misschien heb ik al thee gezet

En als de zon schijnt buiten gaan we lopen door de duinen
En als het regent gaan we t'rug in bed

Uren langzaam wakker worden, zwevend door de tijd
Ik zie het licht door de gordijnen
En ik weet, 't verleden geeft geen zekerheid

Want je kunt niets zeker weten en alles gaat voorbij
Maar ik geloof, ik geloof, ik geloof, ik geloof, ik geloof in jou en mij
Ik geloof, ik geloof, ik geloof, ik geloof, ik geloof in jou en mij

Ik doe de lichten uit en de kamer wordt nu donker
Een straatlantaarn buiten geeft wat licht

En de dingen in de kamer worden vrienden die gaan slapen
De stoelen staan te wachten op 't ontbijt

En morgen wordt ik wakker met de geur van brood en honing
De glans van gouden zonlicht in je haar

En de dingen in de kamer, ik zeg ze welterusten
Vanavond gaan we slapen en morgen zien we wel

Maar de dingen in de kamer zouden levenloze dingen zijn, zonder jou

En je kunt niets zeker weten en alles gaat voorbij
Maar ik geloof, ik geloof, ik geloof, ik geloof, ik geloof in jou en mij
Ik geloof, ik geloof, ik geloof, ik geloof, ik geloof in jou en mij
En je kunt niets zeker weten want alles gaat voorbij
Maar ik geloof, ik geloof, ik geloof, ik geloof, ik geloof in jou en mij
Ik geloof, ik geloof, ik geloof, ik geloof, ik geloof in jou en mij"
10,11,November Rain,Guns N' Roses,1992,"When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But darling, when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same, yeah

Nothing lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

We've been through this such a long, long time
Just trying to kill the pain, ooh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's letting go today, walking away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head just knowing that you were mine, all mine

So if you want to love me
Then darling, don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walking
In the cold November rain

Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time all alone?
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you?

Sometimes I need some time on my own
Sometimes I need some time all alone
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, ooh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame

So nevermind the darkness
We still can find a way
Nothing lasts forever
Even cold November rain

Don't you think that you need somebody?
Don't you think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Don't you think that you need somebody?
Don't you think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Don't you think that you need somebody?
Don't you think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one

Don't you think that you need somebody?
Don't you think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody"
11,12,Love Of My Life,Queen,1986,"Love of my life you've hurt me
You've broken my heart and now you leave me
Love of my life can't you see
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me, because you don't know
What it means to me

Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love, you now desert me
Love of my life can't you see
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me because you don't know
What it means to me

You will remember, when this is blown over, and everything's all by the way
When I grow older, I will be there at your side to remind you
How I still love you - I still love you

Back, hurry back
Please bring it back home to me
Because you don't know what it means to me
Love of my life
Love of my life
Ooh ooh ooh"
12,13,Nothing Else Matters,Metallica,1992,"So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
No, nothing else matters"
13,14,Comfortably Numb,Pink Floyd,1979,"Hello
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?

Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again

Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb

O.K.
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!
But you may feel a little sick

Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone

I have become comfortably numb"
14,15,Brothers In Arms,Dire Straits,1985,"These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be
Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms

Through these fields of destruction
Baptisms of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battle raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms

There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones

Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon's riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die
But it's written in the starlight
And every line in your palm
We're fools to make war
On our brothers in arms"
15,16,Imagine,John Lennon,1971,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky

Imagine all the people
Living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too

Imagine all the people
Living life in peace

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man

Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one"

We can be heroes just for one day

And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that

Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes forever and ever
What d'you say?

I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes just for one day

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be us just for one day

I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)

And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day

We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes

We're nothing and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer just for one day

Just for one day"

Some dancers who gave a good time

19,20,Sultans Of Swing,Dire Straits,1978,"You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park but meantime
South of the river you stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie double four time
You feel alright when you hear that music ring

Well now you step inside but you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
Ah but the horns, they blowing that sound
Way on down south, way on down south, London town

You check out Guitar George, he knows all the chords
Mind, he's strictly rhythm, he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Yes, and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
He can play the honky tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans, with the Sultans of Swing

And a crowd of young boys, they're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call rock and roll
Then the Sultans, yeah, the Sultans they play Creole
Creole

And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last, just as the time bell rings
""Goodnight, now it's time to go home""
Then he makes it fast with one more thing
""We are the Sultans, we are the Sultans of Swing"""

Where, mister, when you're young

We'd drive out of this valley down to where the fields were green

We'd go down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh, down to the river we'd ride

Then I got Mary pregnant
And, man, that was all she wrote
And for my 19th birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat
We went down to the courthouse

And the judge put it all to rest
No wedding day smiles, no walk down the aisle
No flowers, no wedding dress

That night we went down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh, down to the river we did ride

I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy
Now all them things that seemed so important
Well, mister, they vanished right into the air
Now I just act like I don't remember
Mary acts like she don't care

But I remember us riding in my brother's car
Her body tanned and wet down at the reservoir
At night on them banks I'd lie awake
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take

Now those memories come back to haunt me
They haunt me like a curse
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true
Or is it something worse

That sends me down to the river
Though I know the river is dry
That sends me down to the river tonight

Down to the river, my baby and I
Oho, down to the river we ride"
21,22,Hurt,Johnny Cash,2002,"I hurt myself today to see if I still feel
I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away but I remember everything

What have I become, my sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away in the end
And you could have it all, my empire of dirt
I will let you down, I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns upon my liars chair
Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear
You are someone else, I am still right here

What have I become, my sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away in the end
And you could have it all, my empire of dirt
I will let you down,  I will make you hurt

If I could start again, a million miles away
I would keep myself, I would find a way"
22,23,One,Metallica,1994,"I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops with me

Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live

Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

Now the world is gone I'm just one
Oh God help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, help me

Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell

Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell"

24,25,Purple Rain,Prince & The Revolution,1984,"I never meant to cause you any sorrow
I never meant to cause you any pain
I only wanted to one time to see you laughing
I only wanted to see you laughing in the purple rain

Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only wanted to see you bathing in the purple rain

I never wanted to be your weekend lover
I only wanted to be some kind of friend, hey
Baby, I could never steal you from another
It's such a shame our friendship had to end

Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Only wanted to see you underneath the purple rain

Honey, I know
I know, I know times are changin'
It's time we all reach out for something new
That means you too
You say you want a leader
But you can't seem to make up your mind
I think you better close it
And let me guide you to the purple rain

Only want to see you, only wanna see you

25,26,The Sound Of Silence,Simon & Garfunkel,1966,"Hello, darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a streetlamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools,"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sounds of silence"""
26,27,Radar Love,Golden Earring,1973,"I've been driving all night, my hands wet on the wheel
There's a voice in my head that drives my heel
It's my baby calling, says ""I need you here""
And it's a half past four and I'm shifting gear

When she is lonely and the longing gets too much
She sends a cable coming in from above
Don't need no phone at all

We've got a thing that's called radar love
We've got a wave in the air
Radar love

The radio is playing some forgotten song
Brenda Lee's ""Coming On Strong""
The road has got me hypnotized
And I'm speeding into a new sunrise

When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough
She sends her comfort coming in from above
We don't need no letter at all

We've got a thing that's called radar love
We've got a line in the sky
Radar love

No more speed, I'm almost there
Gotta keep cool now, gotta take care
Last car to pass, here I go
And the line of cars goes down real slow

And the radio played that forgotten song
Brenda Lee's ""Coming On Strong""
And the newsman sang his same song
Oh, one more radar lover gone

When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough
She sends her comfort coming in from above
We don't need no letter at all

We've got a thing that's called radar love
We've got a line in the sky
We've got a thing that's called radar love
We've got a thing that's called
Radar love"
27,28,Oceaan,Racoon,2012,"Er is verrekte veel te zeggen
 En te liegen nog veel meer
 Heel veel bagger bloot te leggen 
 Al doet het graven nog zo’n zeer
 Ik ben een eikel maar ik leer

 Een oceaan om in te vluchten 
 Nooit jaloers te hoeven zijn
 Liefde om je hart te luchten 
 Een oceaan hoe lekker zou het zijn

 Was er iets waar ik om wenste
 Voordat de put droog kwam te staan
 Dan was het lang zullen ze leven
 Familie waar ik veel van hou 
 En voor wie ik sterven zou

 Een oceaan om in te schuilen 
 Nooit alleen meer hoeven zijn
 Ik heb gesmeekt niet meer te huilen 
 Alsjeblieft
 Het leven jaagt geen angst meer aan
 Ik heb al zo ver moeten kruipen
 Het laatste stuk zal ook wel gaan
 Tot ik ga staan

 Een oceaan om in te vluchten
 Nooit jaloers te hoeven zijn
 Liefde om je hart te luchten
 Een oceaan alleen van mij

 Een oceaan om te verzuipen
 Een dag of wat een held te zijn
 Laat die ander nu maar kruipen

 Een oceaan vol tranen is van mij
 Alleen van mij"

As if it happened only yesterday
Parking by the lake
And there was not another car in sight
And I never had a girl
Looking any better than you did
And all the kids at school
They were wishing they were me that night

And now our bodies are oh so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
Glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
Come on! Hold on tight!
Well, come on! Hold on tight!

Though it's cold and lonely in the deep, dark night

'Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely dressed

Baby, got to go out and shout it
Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed
'Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely dressed

Baby don'cha hear my heart?
You got it drowning out the radio
I've been a-waiting so long
For you to come along and have some fun
And I gotta let you know
No, you're never gonna regret it
So open up your eyes, I got a big surprise
It'll feel all right
Well, I wanna make your motor run

Okay, here we go, we got a real pressure cooker going here. Two down, nobody on, no score, bottom of the ninth. There's the wind-up, and there it is: a line shot up the middle. Look at him go, this boy can really fly. He's rounding first and really turning it on now. He's not letting up at all, he's gonna try for second. The ball is bobbled out in the center and here comes the throw and what a throw! He's gonna slide in head-first, here he comes... he's out. No, wait, safe! Safe at second base! This kid really makes things happen out there. Batter steps up to the plate. Here's the pitch, and he's going, and what a jump he's got, he's trying for third. Here's the throw... It's in the dirt, safe at third. Holy cow, stolen base. He's taking a pretty big lead out there, almost daring them to try and pick him off. The pitcher glances over, winds-up and it's bunted. Bunted down the third base line and the suicide squeeze is on. Here he comes, squeeze play, it's gonna be close. Here's the throw, here's the play at the plate. Holy cow, I think he's gonna make it...

Stop right there!

I couldn't take it any longer
Lord! I was crazed
And when the feeling came upon me
Like a tidal wave
I started swearing to my God
And on my mother's grave
That I would love you till the end of time
I swore I would love you till the end of time

So now I'm praying for the end of time
To hurry up and arrive
'Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you
I don't think that I can really survive

I'll never break my promise or forget my vow
But God only knows what I can do right now
I'm praying for the end of time
That's all that I can do, ooh, ooh
Praying for the end of time
So I can end my time with you

And it was long ago and it was far away
And it was so much better than it is today

It was long ago and it was far away
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And it was so much better than it is today
And we were glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
It was long ago and it was far away
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And it was so much better than it is today
And we were glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
It was long ago and it was far away
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And it was so much better than it is today
And we were glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife"

Tread that fine line
Oh we'll keep on tryin' - yeah

While we live according to race, colour or creed
While we rule by blind madness and pure greed
Our lives dictated by tradition, superstition, false religion
Through the eons, and on and on

We'll tread that fine line
Oh oh we'll keep on tryin'
Till the end of time

Through the sorrow all through our splendour

You can be anything you want to be
Just turn yourself into anything you think that you could ever be
Be free with your tempo be free be free
Surrender your ego - be free be free to yourself

Ooh, ooh -
If there's a God or any kind of justice under the sky
If there's a point, if there's a reason to live or die
If there's an answer to the questions we feel bound to ask
Show yourself - destroy our fears - release your mask

Oh yes we'll keep on trying
Hey tread that fine line
Yeah we'll keep on smiling yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
And whatever will be - will be
We'll just keep on trying

For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never

Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums

Don't stop me now

Don't stop me now

Don't stop me now

37,38,Under Pressure,David Bowie & Queen,1981,"Mmm num ba dah
Dum bum ba beh
Doo buh dum ba beh beh

Pressure
Pushing down on me
Pressing down on you
No man ask for
Under pressure
That burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

Mmm ba ba beh
Mmm ba ba beh
Bee de dah
Ee deh da, that's okay

It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming ""let me out""
Pray tomorrow
Gets me higher
Pressure on people
People on streets

Deh deh dep
Mmm, mmm
Dah dah dah bah buh
Okay

(Ooh) Chipping around
Kick my brains 'round the floor
These are the days
It never rains, but it pours

Ee do ah buh
Ee dah buh bah bop
Mmm do bop

People on streets
Dee dah dee dah deh
People on streets
Dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah

It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming ""let me out""
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high
Pressure on people
People on streets

Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence, but it don't work
Keep coming up with love, but it's so slashed and torn
Why? Why? Why?
(Love)

Insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love?

'Cause love's such an old fashioned
Word and love dares you to care for
The people on the edge (People on streets) of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure
Under pressure

38,39,The Sound Of Silence,Disturbed,2016,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools,"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence, like a cancer, grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells, of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence"
39,40,Telegraph Road,Dire Straits,1982,"A long time ago came a man on a track
Walking thirty miles with a sack on his back
And he put down his load where he thought it was the best
Made a home in the wilderness

He built a cabin and a winter store
And he ploughed up the ground by the cold lake shore
And the other travellers came walking down the track
And they never went further, no, they never went back

Then came the churches, then came the schools
Then came the lawyers, then came the rules
Then came the trains and the trucks with their load
And the dirty old track was the Telegraph Road

Then came the mines, then came the ore
Then there was the hard times, then there was a war
Telegraph sang a song about the world outside
Telegraph Road got so deep and so wide
Like a rolling river

And my radio says tonight it's gonna freeze
People driving home from the factories
There's six lanes of traffic
Three lanes moving slow

I used to like to go to work but they shut it down
I've got a right to go to work but there's no work here to be found
Yes, and they say we're gonna have to pay what's owed
We're gonna have to reap from some seed that's been sowed

And the birds up on the wires and the telegraph poles
They can always fly away from this rain and this cold
You can hear them singing out their telegraph code
All the way down the Telegraph Road

Well, I'd sooner forget, but I remember those nights
Yeah, life was just a bet on a race between the lights
You had your hand on my shoulder, you had your hand in my hair
Now you act a little colder like you don't seem to care

But just believe in me baby and I'll take you away
From out of this darkness and into the day
From these rivers of headlights, these rivers of rain
From the anger that lives on the streets with these names
'Cause I've run every red light on memory lane
I've seen desperation explode into flames
And I don't wanna see it again

From all of these signs saying ""Sorry but we're closed""
All the way down the Telegraph Road"
40,41,In The Air Tonight,Phil Collins,1981,"I can feel it coming in the air tonight

Can you feel it coming in the air tonight?
Oh Lord, oh Lord

Well, if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before, my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am

Well, I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies

And I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life

Well, I remember
I remember, don't worry
How could I ever forget?
It's the first time, the last time we ever met

But I know the reason why you keep this silence up
No, you don't fool me
The hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows
It's no stranger to you and me

I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life

How can I when you won't take it from me?

You can go your own way

You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way

Packing up, shacking up's all you want to do

Kept his dick wet
With his same old safe bet

Me and my head high
And my tears dry
Get on without my guy

You went back to what you knew
So far removed
From all that we went through

And I tread a troubled track
My odds are stacked
I go back to black

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...
I go back to us

I love you much
It's not enough
You love blow and I love puff

And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny
Rolling up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...

Black, black, black, black
Black, black, black
I go back to

43,44,School,Supertramp,1974,"I can see you in the morning when you go to school,
Don't forget your books, you know you've got to learn the golden rule,
Teacher tells you stop your play and get on with your work
And be like Johnnie - too-good, well don't you know he never shirks
- He's coming along!

After School is over you're playing in the park
Don't be out too late, don't let it get too dark
They tell you not to hang around and learn what life's about
And grow up just like them - won't let you work it out
- And you're full of doubt

Don't do this and don't do that
What are they trying to do? 
- Make a good boy of you
Do they know where it's at?
Don't criticise, they're old and wise
Do as they tell you to
Don't want the devil to
Come and put out your eyes

Maybe I'm mistaken expecting you to fight
Or maybe I'm just crazy, I don't know wrong from right
But while I am still living I've just got this to say
It's always up to you if you want to be that
Want to see that
Want to see it that way
- You're coming along!"

Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are

I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start

Running in circles
Coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard

Oh take me back to the start

I was just guessing
At numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart

Questions of science
Science and progress
Could not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh when I rush to the start

Running in circles
Chasing tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard

46,47,In The End,Linkin Park,2000,"(It starts with one)
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind; I designed this rhyme
To explain, in due time
All I know; time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal

Didn't look out below
Watched the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind; I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so (far)

Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all

I was 'round when Jesus Christ had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you -- hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

Stuck around St. Petersburg when I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the czar and his ministers; Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank, when the blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you -- hope you guess my name, oh yeah
Ah, what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, oh yeah

I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out ""Who killed the Kennedys?""
When after all, it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself: I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours who get killed before they reach Bombay

Have some sympathy and some taste

Did I disappoint you?
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

Did I ask too much, more than a lot?
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other then we do it again

You say
Love is a temple, love, a higher law
Love is a temple, love, the higher law
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt

One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life with each other

Er wandelen mensen langs vlaggen en vaandels
Waar Lenin en Marx nog steeds op een voetstuk staan

En iedereen werkt, hamers en sikkels
Terwijl in paradepas de wacht wordt gewisseld
Veertig jaar socialisme, er is in die tijd veel bereikt

Maar wat is nou die heilstaat als er muren omheen staan
Als je bang en voorzichtig met je mening moet omgaan
Ach wat is nou die heilstaat, zeg mij wat is hij waard
Wanneer iemand die afwijkt voor gek wordt verklaard

En alleen de vogels vliegen van Oost- naar West-Berlijn
Worden niet teruggefloten, ook niet neergeschoten
Over de muur, over het ijzeren gordijn
Omdat ze soms in het westen, soms ook in het oosten willen zijn
Omdat ze soms in het westen, soms ook in het oosten willen zijn

West-Berlijn, de Kurfürstendamm
Er wandelen mensen langs porno- en peepshow
Waar Mercedes en Cola nog steeds op een voetstuk staan

En de neonreclames die glitterend lokken
Kom dansen, kom eten, kom zuipen, kom gokken
Dat is nou veertig jaar vrijheid, er is in die tijd veel bereikt

Maar wat is nou die vrijheid zonder huis zonder baan
Zoveel Turken in Kreuzberg die amper kunnen bestaan
Goed, je mag demonstreren, maar met je rug tegen de muur
En alleen als je geld hebt, dan is de vrijheid niet duur

En de vogels vliegen van West- naar Oost-Berlijn
Worden niet teruggefloten, ook niet neergeschoten
Over de muur, over het ijzeren gordijn
Omdat ze soms in het oosten, soms ook in het westen willen zijn
Omdat er brood ligt soms bij de Gedächtniskirche
Soms op het Alexanderplein"
60,61,Bridge Over Troubled Water,Simon & Garfunkel,1970,"When you're weary
Feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I will dry them all

I'm on your side, whoa
When times get rough
And friends just can't be found

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you

I'll take your part, oh
When darkness comes
And pain is all around

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

Sail on, silvergirl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way

See how they shine, oh
If you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind!"

62,63,Lose Yourself,Eminem,2002,"Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment...
Would you capture it or just let it slip?

(Yo) His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting

What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks runs out, time's up, over, blow

Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy no, he won't have it he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope

He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but super-stardom's

Close to postmortem, it only grows harder
Only grows hotter, he blows us all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads God only knows

He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home, and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product

They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera
Is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna'
But the beat goes on, da da dum da dum da da da dum

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

No more games, I'mma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off, like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage

But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five

And I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, 'cause man these goddamn
Food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life

And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a Prima Donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much for me to wanna

Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not

Mom I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime (You better)

You can do anything you set your mind to, man."
63,64,Het Dorp,Wim Sonneveld,1974,"Thuis heb ik nog een ansichtkaart
Waarop een kerk een kar met paard
Een slagerij J. van der Ven
Een kroeg, een juffrouw op de fiets
Het zegt u hoogstwaarschijnlijk niets
Maar het is waar ik geboren ben
Dit dorp, ik weet nog hoe het was
De boerenkind'ren in de klas
Een kar die ratelt op de keien
Het raadhuis met een pomp ervoor
Een zandweg tussen koren door
Het vee, de boerderijen

En langs het tuinpad van m'n vader
Zag ik de hoge bomen staan
Ik was een kind en wist niet beter
Dan dat ‘t nooit voorbij zou gaan

Wat leefden ze eenvoudig toen
In simp'le huizen tussen groen
Met boerenbloemen en een heg
Maar blijkbaar leefden ze verkeerd
Het dorp is gemoderniseerd
En nou zijn ze op de goeie weg
Want ziet, hoe rijk het leven is
Ze zien de televisiequiz
En wonen in betonnen dozen
Met flink veel glas, dan kun je zien
Hoe of het bankstel staat bij Mien
En d'r dressoir met plastic rozen

En langs het tuinpad van m'n vader
Zag ik de hoge bomen staan
Ik was een kind en wist niet beter
Dan dat ‘t nooit voorbij zou gaan

De dorpsjeugd klit wat bij elkaar
In minirok en beatle-haar
En joelt wat mee met beat-muziek
Ik weet wel het is hun goeie recht
De nieuwe tijd, net wat u zegt
Maar het maakt me wat melancholiek
Ik heb hun vaders nog gekend
Ze kochten zoethout voor een cent
Ik zag hun moeders touwtjespringen
Dat dorp van toen, het is voorbij
Dit is al wat er bleef voor mij
Een ansicht en herinneringen

Toen ik langs het tuinpad van m'n vader
De hoge bomen nog zag staan
Ik was een kind, hoe kon ik weten
Dat dat voorgoed voorbij zou gaan"
64,65,Old And Wise,Alan Parsons Project,1982,"As far as my eyes can see
There are shadows approaching me

And to those I left behind
I wanted you to know
You've always shared my deepest thoughts
You follow where I go

And, oh, when I'm old and wise
Bitter words mean little to me
Autumn winds will blow right through me

And someday in the mist of time
When they asked me if I knew you
I'd smile and say you were a friend of mine

And the sadness would be lifted from my eyes
Oh, when I'm old and wise

As far as my eyes can see
There are shadows surrounding me

And to those I leave behind
I want you all to know
You've always shared my darkest hours
I'll miss you when I go

And, oh, when I'm old and wise
Heavy words that tossed and blew me
Like autumn winds will blow right through me

And someday in the mist of time
When they ask you if you knew me
Remember that you were a friend of mine

As the final curtain falls before my eyes
Oh, when I'm old and wise

As far as my eyes can see"
65,66,Under The Bridge,Red Hot Chili Peppers,1991,"Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, the city of angels
Lonely as I am, together we cry

I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

And I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way

Yeah, yeah-yeah

It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love, the city, she loves me
Lonely as I am, together we cry

Well, I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
Well, I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way

Yeah, yeah-yeah
Oh, no, no, no, yeah-yeah
Love me, I said, yeah, yeah

Is where I drew some blood
Under the bridge downtown
I could not get enough
Under the bridge downtown
Forgot about my love
Under the bridge downtown
I gave my life away

Alone, I said, oh yeah-yeah (away)
Will I stay?"
66,67,Dancing Queen,ABBA,1976,"Ooh, you can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go, mm
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king

Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah

You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

You're a tease, you turn 'em on
Leave them burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah

You can dance, you can jive

But I just can't get no relief, Lord!

Somebody, ooh somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

I work hard every day of my life
I work till I ache my bones
At the end (of the day)
I take home my hard earned pay all on
My own-I get down on my knees
And I start to pray
Till the tears run down from my eyesLord
Somebody, ooh somebody
Can anybody find me-somebody to love?

(He works hard) Everyday-I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Aw they ain't got no common sense
He's got nobody left to believe in

Ooh ooh ooh ooh somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Can anybody find me to love?

Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat
I'm all right, I'm all right
I ain't gonna face no defeat
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord!

Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love

Bodies strewn across the dead-end street

And mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart

Calling my name
The sound is deep
In the dark

Into the trees

Serves now to define our cold society

Over fear and into freedom

You just got to hold on!

The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed
The bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress
The hate of men will pass, and dictators die
And the power they took from the people will return to the people
And so long as men die, liberty will never perish
Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men
Machine men with machine minds and machine hearts!
You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men!
You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful
To make this life a wonderful adventure
Let us use that power!
Let us all unite!)

Confidential information - it's in a diary
This is my investigation - it's not a public inquiry

I go checking out the reports - digging up the dirt
You get to meet all sorts in this line of work
Treachery and treason - there's always an excuse for it
And when I find the reason I still can't get used to it

And what have you got at the end of the day?
What have you got to take away?
A bottle of whisky and a new set of lies
Blinds on the windows and a pain behind the eyes

Scarred for life - no compensation
Private investigations"

And the stars look very different today

I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much"" - ""She knows.

81,82,Billie Jean,Michael Jackson,1983,"She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And Mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)

She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one

She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

She says I am the one

Breaking my heart babe)

Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery

In conversation

Met a man in China
Went down to Geisha Minah

For cars she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

We shall go on till the end, we shall fight on the seas and oceans.
We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.
We shall never surrender.

History recalls, how great the fall can be
While everybody's sleeping
The boat's put out to sea
Borne on the wings of time
It seems the answers were so easy to find

Too late the prophets cry
The island's sinking, let's take to the sky
Called the man a fool
Stripped him off his pride
Everyone was laughing
Up until the day he died

Ooh though the wound went deep
Still he's calling us out of our sleep
My friends, we're not alone
He waits in silence to lead us all home

So you tell me that you find it hard to grow
Well I know, I know, I know
And you tell me that you've many seeds to sow
Well I know, I know, I know

On England's pleasant pastures seen?
And did the Countenance Divine,
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?

Can you see the parts that I'm playing?
Holy Man, Rocker Man, Come on Queenie,

92,93,Goodnight Saigon,Billy Joel,1983,"We met as soulmates
On Parris Island
We left as inmates
From an asylum
And we were sharp, as sharp as knives
And we were so gung-ho to lay down our lives

We came in spastic
Like tameless horses
We left in plastic
As numbered corpses
And we learned fast to travel light
Our arms were heavy but our bellies were tight

We had no home front
We had no soft soap
They sent us Playboy
They gave us Bob Hope
We dug in deep and shot on sight
And prayed to Jesus Christ with all of our might

We had no cameras
To shoot the landscape
We passed the hash pipe
And played our Doors tapes
And it was dark, so dark at night
And we held on to each other
Like brother to brother
We promised our mothers we'd write

And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes, we would all go down together

Remember Charlie?
Remember Baker?
They left their childhood
On every acre
And who was wrong? And who was right?
It didn't matter in the thick of the fight

We held the day
In the palm of our hand
They ruled the night
And the night seemed to last as long as
Six weeks on Parris Island
We held the coastline
They held the highlands
And they were sharp, as sharp as knives
They heard the hum of our motors
They counted the rotors
And waited for us to arrive

And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes, we would all go down together"

100,101,Het Regent Zonnestralen,Acda & De Munnik,1998,"Op een terras ergens in Frankrijk in de zon
Zit een man die het tot gisteren nooit won
Maar zijn auto vloog hier vlakbij uit de bocht
Zonder hem, zonder Herman
Want die had hem net verkocht

Herman in de zon op een terras
Leest in 't AD dat 'ie niet meer in leven was
Zijn auto was volledig afgebrand
En de man die hem gekocht had
Stond onder zijn naam in de krant

(CHORUS):

O, o, o, even rustig ademhalen
O, o, o, lijkt of het regent als altijd
Maar het regent en het regent zonnestralen

Een week geleden in een park in Amsterdam
Had 'ie z'n leven overzien en schrok zich lam
Hij was een man wiens leven nu al was bepaald
En van al z'n jongensdromen
Was alleen het oud worden gehaald

(CHORUS)

Op een bankje in 't park kwam het besluit
Noem het dapper, noem het vluchten, maar ik knijp er tussenuit
Nu een week geleden en hier zat 'ie dan maar weer
Met meer vrijheid dan hem lief was en nou wist 'ie het niet meer

Herman leest wel honderd keer de krant
'T staat er echt, pagina achttien, zwartomrand
Hield 'ie vroeger al zijn meningen en al zijn dromen stil
Nu was 'ie niks, niet, niemand nergens meer
Kan dus gaan waar 'ie maar wil

Herman rekent af en staat dan op
Hij heeft eindelijk de wind weer in z'n kop
""Ik heb een tweede kans gekregen
En da's meer dan ik verdien
Maar als dit het is dit het, als dit het is dit het
Als dit het is dit het en we zullen het wel zien""

(CHORUS) 2x

En het regent zonnestralen.."

Boort mijn vuur, mijn liefde, zich in de aarde
En bij het water speelt een kind
En alle schelpen die het vindt gaan blinken als ik lach

'k Hou van je warmte op mijn gezicht
Ik hou van de koperen kleur van je licht
Ik geef je water in mijn hand
En schelpen uit het zoute zand

Ik scheur de rotsen met mijn stralen
Verhoog de meren in de dalen en
Onweersluchten doe ik vluchten, aah als de regen valt
Verberg je ogen in een hand
Voordat m'n glimlach ze verbrandt

Want even later komt de nacht en schijnt de koele maan

De nacht is te koud, de maan te grijs
Toe neem me toch mee naar je hemelpaleis
Daar wil ik zijn alleen met jou
En stralen in het hemelblauw
Ik heb je lief, zo lief

Als ik de aarde ga verwarmen
Laat ik haar leven in m'n armen
Van sterren weefde ik het verre, aah het noorderlicht
Maar soms ben ik als kolkend lood
Ik ben het leven en de dood
In vuur, in liefde, in alle tijden
M'n kind ik troost je, kijk omhoog
Vandaag span ik mijn regenboog
Die is alleen voor jou

Nee nooit sta ik een seconde stil
'k Wil liever branden neem me mee
Geen mens kan mij dwingen wanneer ik niet wil
Wanneer je vanavond gaat slapen in zee
Geen leven dat ik niet begon
En vliegen langs jouw hemelbaan
Je kunt niet houden van de zon
Ik wil niet meer bij jou vandaan

Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line
Does anybody want to take it anymore?

My makeup may be flaking
But my smile still stays on

Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on
Does anybody know what we are living for?

I guess I'm learning, I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning 'round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside, in the dark, I'm aching to be free

The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile still stays on

My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairy tales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly, my friends

The show must go on
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show

En soms, wanneer ik m`n ogen sluit
Lopen we samen op `t strand,
Haar handje in de mijne
En dan, zet ze de tijd even stil
Is het weer even net als toen
En heeft ze mij weer nodig

119,120,Kleine Jongen,André Hazes,1990,"Kleine jongen
Je bent op deze wereld
Dus zal je moeten vechten net als ik

Ik kan het weten
Het leven is niet makkelijk
Er is tegenspoed op ieder ogenblik

Kleine jongen
Er zijn veel goeie mensen
Maar slechte zijn er ook, helaas 't is waar

Je moet maar denken
Dat jij straks gaat beseffen
Dat eerlijk het langste duurt, geloof me maar

Dit leven gaat voorbij
Er is zo weinig tijd, dus leef want jij bent vrij
Maar doe het wel verstandig, maak de mensen blij
Dan zul je echt gelukkig zijn

Want het leven is zo kort
Veel dingen worden anders als je ouder wordt
Je speelt nu nog met blokken maar dat duurt niet lang
Het is jammer maar je blijft niet klein

Kleine jongen
Op school al zul je merken
Dat alles draait om cijfers en om macht

Zo is 't leven
Dus leer wat je moet leren
Want dan ben jij degeen die het laatste lacht

Kleine jongen
Als jij dan later groot bent
Dan is je vader er misschien niet meer

Vertel dan
Aan je eigen kinderen
De wijze lessen van je ouwe heer

Dit leven gaat voorbij
Er is zo weinig tijd, dus leef want jij bent vrij
Maar doe het wel verstandig, maak de mensen blij
Dan zul je echt gelukkig zijn

Want het leven is zo kort
Veel dingen worden anders als je ouder wordt
Je speelt nu nog met blokken maar dat duurt niet lang
Het is jammer maar je blijft niet klein

Don't you know you might find
A better place to play?
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Will slowly fade away

So I'll start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

And so Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
""But don't look back in anger"" I heard you say

Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows
If it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock and roll band
Who'll throw it all away

I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed

There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go, I don't know

For the times that I watched and let you stumble

It's too bad, but that's me
What goes around comes around, and you'll see
That I can carry the burden of pain
'Cause it ain't the first time that a man goes insane
And when I spread my wings to embrace him for life
Suckin' out his love, I, I'll never be nobody's wife

I'm sorry
For the times that I didn't come home
Left you lyin' in that bed alone
Was flyin' high in the sky when you needed my shoulder

Like a stone hangin' round my neck, see
Cut it loose before it breaks my back, see
I've gotta say what I feel before I grow older

I'm sorry but I ain't gonna change my ways
You know I've tried but I'm still the same
I got to do it my way

Meet me down by the gallow tree

About this old town and all that it's offering

One day we'll return here
When the Belfast child sings again

Brothers, sisters, where are you now?
As I look for you right through the crowd
All my life here I've spent
With my faith in God, the Church and the Government
But there's sadness abound
Some day soon they're gonna pull the old town down

One day we'll return here
When the Belfast child sings again
When the Belfast child sings again

So come back, Billy, won't you come on home?
Come back, Mary, you've been away so long
The streets are empty, and your mother's gone
The girls are crying, it's been oh so long
And your father's calling, come on home
Won't you come on home, won't you come on home?

Come back people, you've been gone a while
And the war is raging, through the Emerald Isle
That's flesh and blood man, that's flesh and blood
All the girls are crying but all's not lost

The streets are empty, the streets are cold
Won't you come on home, won't you come on home?

The streets are empty
Life goes on

One day we'll return here

On the other side from you

I find the lot
Falls through without you

My one dream, my only master

Too long I roam in the night
I'm coming back to his side to put it right
I'm coming home to Wuthering, Wuthering

That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you.

I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.

I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her finger tips
It burned like fire
This burning desire.

I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.

I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one.
But yes, I'm still running.

You broke the bonds
And you loosened the chains
Carried the cross of all my shame
All my shame, you know I believe it.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for."

A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there
You had your time you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

138,139,The Last Resort,Eagles,1976,"She came from Providence, the one in Rhode Island
Where the old world shadows hang heavy in the air
She packed her hopes and dreams like a refugee
Just as her father came across the sea

She heard about a place people were smilin'
They spoke about the red man's way, and how they loved the land
And they came from everywhere to the Great Divide
Seeking a place to stand or a place to hide

Down in the crowded bars, out for a good time,
Can't wait to tell you all, what it's like up there
And they called it paradise I don't know why
Somebody laid the mountains low while the town got high

Then the chilly winds blew down across the desert
Through the canyons of the coast, to the Malibu
Where the pretty people play, hungry for power
To light their neon way and give them things to do

Some rich men came and raped the land, nobody caught 'em
Put up a bunch of ugly boxes, and Jesus, people bought them
And they called it paradise the place to be
They watched the hazy sun, sinking in the sea

You can leave it all behind and sail to Lahaina
Just like the missionaries did, so many years ago
They even brought a neon sign: Jesus is coming
Brought the white man's burden down, brought the white man's reign

Who will provide the grand design? What is yours and what is mine?
'Cause there is no more new frontier we have got to make it here
We satisfy our endless needs and justify our bloody deeds,
In the name of destiny and in the name of God

And you can see them there, on Sunday morning
Stand up and sing about what it's like up there
They call it paradise I don't know why
You call someplace paradise, kiss it goodbye"

You know it drives me wild
Her lips are warm and resourceful
When her fingertips,
Go drawing circles in the night

Every time it feels like the earth is shakin'
It doesn't matter, a glass is fallin',
I hear it shatter,
Maybe it's raining, faster and faster, shadow dancin'
Together oh I, I'm a bettin' on the game of love
Oh oh oh I, I'm bettin' that love is gonna come out
When the walls no longer shout, back at me
And I'm feelin' proud

When the lady smiles,
She holds me in her hand
As a matter of fact,
She could always let me down
But when the lady smiles,
I can't resist her call
As a matter of fact,
I don't resist at all
'Cause I'm walking on clouds
And she is leadin' the way

My friends tell me,
She's the beast inside your paradise
I guess you've heard it all before
A fallen angel,
That has got you hypnotized
And that always needs some more, hu-u
And I love it, yeah I love it
She's done nothin' to mislead me
'Cause every time we meet,
The earth is shakin'
It doesn't matter, a glass is fallin'
I hear it shatter, maybe it's rainin'
Faster and faster, shadow dancin'

143,144,Make You Feel My Love,Adele,2008,"When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
And I'd go crawling down the avenue
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me, yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love"

The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, your faith was strong, but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya

And she tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya

And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do ya?

But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, maybe there is a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit, Jody got married
I should've known we'd never get far

Oh when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

Hey!

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life - Oh yeah
Back in the summer of '69

Oh

Man, we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever, forever, no

Yay!

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six string
I think about you, wonder what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that it'd last forever
Oh and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life - Oh yeah

Come crashing in, into my little world
Painful to me, pierce right through me
Can't you understand, oh, my little girl

All I ever wanted, all I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Vows are spoken to be broken
Feelings are intense, words are trivial
Pleasures remain, so does the pain
Words are meaningless and forgettable

All I ever wanted, all I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

All I ever wanted, all I ever needed

To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart

It's so typical of me to talk
About myself, I'm sorry

Where nothing ever happened?

Are running out of time

And turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kind of seasick
But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
Would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well have been closed

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

153,154,The Boxer,Simon & Garfunkel,1969,"I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises

All lies and jest
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest

When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared

Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue

I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone
Going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me
Going home

In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving""
But the fighter still remains"
154,155,Fragile,Sting,1988,"If blood will flow when flesh and steel are one
Drying in the colour of the evening sun
Tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away
But something in our minds will always stay

Perhaps this final act was meant
To clinch a lifetime's argument
That nothing comes from violence
And nothing ever could
For all those born beneath an angry star
Lest we forget how fragile we are

On and on the rain will fall
Like tears from a star
Like tears from a star
On and on the rain will say
How fragile we are
How fragile we are

On and on the rain will fall
Like tears from a star
Like tears from a star
On and on the rain will say
How fragile we are
How fragile we are
How fragile we are

It's hard to tell the nighttime from the day
You're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences
Open the gate
It may be rainin'
But there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
(Let somebody love you)
You better let somebody love you
Before it's too late"
159,160,Hurricane,Bob Dylan,1975,"Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall.
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood,
Cries out, ""My God, they've killed them all!""
Here comes the story of the Hurricane,
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world.

Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see
And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously.
""I didn't do it,"" he says, and he throws up his hands
""I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand.
I saw them leavin',"" he says, and he stops
""One of us had better call up the cops.""
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night.

Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around.
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that.
In Paterson that's just the way things go.
If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
'Less you wanna draw the heat.

Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around
He said, ""I saw two men runnin' out, they looked like little apes
They jumped into a white car without-of-state plates.""
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head.
Cop said, ""Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead""
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
He told 'em he could identify the guilty men.

Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in,
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
The wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye
Says, ""Why'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!""
Yes, here's the story of the Hurricane,
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world.

Four months later, the ghettos are in flame,
Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
And the cops are puttin' the screws to him, lookin' for somebody to blame.
""Remember that murder that happened in a bar?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
You think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin' that night?
Don't forget that you are white.""

Arthur Dexter Bradley said, ""I'm really not sure.""
The cop said, ""A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job and we're talkin' to your friend Bello
You don't wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
You'll be doin' society a favor.
That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver.
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain't no Gentleman Jim.""

Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
""It's my work,"" he'd say, ""I do it for pay
And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along the trail.""
But then they took him to the jailhouse
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse.

All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance.
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger.
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger.
And though they could not produce the gun,
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed.

Rubin Carter was falsely tried.
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
Where justice is a game.

Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sunrise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell.
Yes, that's the story of the Hurricane,
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he's done.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world."
160,161,Laat Me,Ramses Shaffy,1978,"Ik ben misschien te laat geboren,
of in een land met ander licht.
Ik voel me altijd wat verloren,
al toont de spiegel mijn gezicht.
Ik ken de kroegen, kathedralen,
van Amsterdam tot aan Maastricht.
Toch zal ik elke dag verdwalen,
dat houd de zaak in evenwicht.

Laat me, laat me
Laat me m'n eigen gang maar gaan.
Laat me, laat me,
Ik heb het altijd zo gedaan.

Ik zal m'n vrienden niet vergeten,
want wie me lief is blijft me lief.
En waar ze woonde moest ik weten,
maar ik verloor hun laatste brief.
Ik zal ze heus nog wel ontmoeten,
misschien vandaag misschien over een jaar.
Ik zal ze kussen en begroeten,
komt vanzelf weer voor elkaar.

Laat me, laat me
Laat me m'n eigen gang maar gaan.
Laat me, laat me,
Ik heb het altijd zo gedaan.

Ik ben gelukkig niet verankerd,
soms woon ik hier, soms leef ik daar.
Ik heb m'n leven niet verkankerd,
Ik heb geen bezit en geen bezwaar.
Ik hou van water en van adem,
ik hou van schamel en van duur.
Er is geen stuiver die ik spaarde,
ik leef gewoon van uur tot uur.

Laat me, laat me
Laat me m'n eigen gang maar gaan.
Laat me, laat me,
Ik heb het altijd zo gedaan.

Ik zal ook wel eens een keertje sterven,
daar kom ik echt niet onderuit.
Ik laat m'n liedjes nou maar zwerven,
en verder zoek je het maar uit.
Voorlopig blijf ik nog jouw zanger,
jouw zwarte schaap, jouw trouwe fan.
Ik blijf nog lang en liefst nog langer,
laat me blijven wie ik ben.

Laat me, laat me
Laat me m'n eigen gang maar gaan.
Laat me, laat me,
Ik heb het altijd zo gedaan.

Laat me, laat me
Laat me m'n eigen gang maar gaan.
Laat me, laat me,
Ik heb het altijd zo gedaan."

Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare

See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringin' me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn

Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door (Wohh ho ho oh)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (Wohh oh oh oh)

Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Wohh ho ho oh)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it, you played it, you played it
You played it to the beat"

It'll rain a sunny day

Shinin' down like water

Have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day?

Yesterday and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard

Been that way for all my time

Till forever upon it goes
Through the circle fast and slow

It can't stop, I wonder

I was unrecognizable to myself
Saw my reflection in a window and didn't know my own face
Oh, brother, are you gonna leave me wasting away
On the streets of Philadelphia?

I walked the avenue 'til my legs felt like stone
I heard voices of friends vanished and gone
At night I could hear the blood in my veins
Just as black and whispering as the rain
On the streets of Philadelphia

Ain't no angel gonna greet me
It's just you and I, my friend
And my clothes don't fit me no more
I walked a thousand miles just to slip this skin

The night has fallen and I'm lying awake
I can feel myself fading away
So receive me, brother, with your faithless kiss
Or will we leave each other alone like this
On the streets of Philadelphia?"

Still my guitar gently weeps

How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and so-old you

I look at the world
And I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
(With) every mistake
We must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
Yeah

I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No-one alerted you

Tonight, I throw myself into

Come down and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow how you wanted it to be
I'm over my head, out of her head she sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang

Breathe out so I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now I know you've always been
Out of your head, out of my head I sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you

And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park

And when the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklores
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

Your only rivers run cold
These city lights
They shine as silver and gold
Dug from the night
Your eyes as black as coal

Walk on by, walk on through
Walk till you run and don't look back
For here I am

Carnival
The wheels fly and the colours spin
Through alcohol
Red wine that punctures the skin
Face to face
In a dry and waterless place

Walk on by, walk on through
So sad to besiege your love
Oh, hang on

Stay this time
Stay tonight in a lie
I'm only asking
But I, I think you know
Come on take me away
Come on take me away
Come on take me home
Home again

And if the mountains should crumble
Or disappear into the sea
Not a tear, no, not I

Stay this time
Stay tonight in a lie
Ever after is a long time
And if you save your love
Save it all, save it all
Don't push me too far
Don't push me too far
Tonight, tonight"

May be my treasure or
The price I have to pay

May be the chill that autumn brings
May be a hundred different things
Within the measure of a day

She may be the beauty or the beast
May be the famine or the feast
May turn each day into a heaven
Or hell

She may be the mirror of my dream
A smile reflected in a stream
She may not be what she may seem
Inside her shell

She who always seems so happy in a crowd
Whose eyes can be so private and so proud
No-one's allowed to see them
When they cry

She may be the love that cannot hope to last
May come to me from shadows of the past
That I'll remember
Till the day I die

She may be the reason I survive
The why and wherefore I'm alive
The one I'll care for
Through the rough and rainy years

Me, I'll take her laughter and her tears
And make them all my souvenirs
For where she goes I've got to be
The meaning of my life is she

She
Mmm, she"

Front of the supermarket door-way child

Hey girl, on a cold summernight,
As we stood on the corner,
As a man passed by and asked us,
What we were doing what we need,
As he pointed his big fat finger
To the people hangin' round at the corner of the - other side of street
Oh well

Doin' nothing, just hanging around,
What do you mean doin' nothing Sir.
So we had to hit him to the ground,
Doin' nothing just hanging around.

About the things we've gone through

I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence

Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules

The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear

The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain?

But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?

Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say
Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
Always staying low

The game is on again
A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand

I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence

But you see
The winner takes it all!
The winner takes it all!

So the winner takes it all
And the loser has to fall

Throw a dice
Cold as ice
Way down here
Someone near

Takes it all
Has to fall
Can't explain
I complain

Some say love, it is a razor

Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower
And you, its only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance

It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul, afraid of dyin'
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
That you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong

Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose"

 Soms begint ze in mijn hart te zingen 
 Waar het nacht wordt heeft ze lichtjes aangedaan 
 En door haar weet ik dan door te dringen 
 Tot de onvermoede schat van ons bestaan 
 Zo alleen maar wil ik verder leven 
 Schuilend bij elkaar 
 En als ik oud moet worden, dan alleen met haar 

 Zij kent al mijn dromen en mijn wanen 
 Al mijn haast en al mijn honger en mijn spijt 
 Als ik lach kent zij alleen de tranen 
 Die daar achter liggen in de tijd 
 Zo alleen maar wil ik verder leven 
 Schuilend bij elkaar 
 En als ik oud moet worden, dan alleen met haar

 En een wonder draag ik met me mee"

But I never saw the good side of the city

Till I hitched a ride on a river boat queen

Big wheels keep on turning
Proud Mary keeps on burning
Rolling
Rolling
Rolling on the river

If you come down to the river

Betcha gonna find the people who live

You don't have to worry though you have no money
People on the river are happy to give

Big wheels keep on turning
Proud Mary keeps on burning
Rolling
Rolling
Rolling on the river"

I used to feel so uninspired (a-ooh)
And when I knew I had to face another day (a-ooh)
Lord, it made me feel so tired

Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
But you're the key to my peace of mind

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)

When my soul was in the lost-and-found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it

Now I'm no longer doubtful
Of what I'm living for
And if I make you happy I don't need to do more

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)

Oh, baby, what you've done to me? (What you've done to me?)
You make me feel so good inside (good inside)
And I just wanna be (wanna be)
Close to you, you make me feel so alive

I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole

And fade out again
And fade out

This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under

And fade out again
And fade out again

Cracked eggs, dead birds scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes

All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole

And fade out again
And fade out again

Immerse your soul in love

So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At Skyfall

At Skyfall

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

We will stand tall
And face it all together

Where you go, I go
What you see, I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security

Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall

In his arms she fell as her hair came down
Among the fields of gold

And there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left

Take me home, country roads

Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

West Virginia, Mountain Mama
Take me home, country roads

I hear her voice, in the mornin' hour she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
And drivin' down the road, I get a feelin
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
Been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

You see, my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
Still ain't got a job
Now I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

So remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder

Leave this heart of clay, see you walk, walk away
Into the night, and through the rain
Into the half light and through the flame

If I could, through myself, set your spirit free
I'd lead your heart away, see you break, break away
Into the light and to the day

To let it go and so to fade away
To let it go and so fade away
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake, wide awake
I'm not sleeping

If you should ask, then maybe
They'd tell you what I would say
True colours fly in blue and black
Bruised silken sky and burning flak
Colours crash, collide in blood-shot eyes

If I could, you know I would
If I could, I would let it go

This desperation, dislocation
Separation, condemnation
Revelation, in temptation
Isolation, desolation

Do you remember the loving on the floor in Belsize Park?
Do you remember dancing in stilettos in the snow?
Do you remember you never understood I had to go?

Please excuse me, I never meant to break your heart
So sorry, I never meant to break your heart
But you broke mine

Kayleigh, I just want to say I'm sorry
But, Kayleigh, I'm too scared to pick up the phone
To hear you've found another lover to patch up our broken home

I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead

With an ironclad fist
I wake up and french kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps it's own beat
In my head while we're talking

About all of the things that I long to believe
About love, the truth and what you mean to me
And the truth is
Baby, you're all that I need

I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails
Oh, I wanna be just as close as your Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on bed of roses

Well I'm so far away
Each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes, I'd give each night
To see through this pay phone

Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
""Baby, blind love is true.""

I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails
Oh, I wanna be just as close as your Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on bed of roses

Well, this hotel bar's hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked and she's giving me the eye
Well, I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died, ooh yeah

Now as you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress, she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again

Tonight, I won't be alone
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
I got nothing to prove
For it's you that I'd die to defend

I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I'll sleep on a bed of nails
Oh, I wanna be just as close as your Holy Ghost is
And lay you down

I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses

You're in the mud
In the maze of her imagination

You love this town
Even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over
And it's been all over you

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Oh

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out

See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light and
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood, all the colours came out

It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

What you don't have, you don't need it now
What you don't know, you can feel it somehow
What you don't have, you don't need it now
Don't need it now

It's a beautiful day"

The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you find

Should have known better, yeah
Oh, oh

I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, ooh

Never without your love

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say

We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay

And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again

Take my hand, stop, put van the man on the jukebox

And now I'm singing like

Girl you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

And skies turned to grey,
The night keeps on closing in on the day.
A nightingale sings his song of farewell,
You better hide for her freezing hell.

On cold wings she's coming,
You better keep moving.
For warmth, you'll be longing.
Come on just feel it,
Don't you see it?
You better believe.

When she embraces,
Your heart turns to stone.
She comes at night when you are all alone.
And when she whispers,
Your blood shall run cold.
You better hide before she finds you.

Whenever she is raging,
She takes life away.
Haven't you seen,
Haven't you seen,
The ruins of our world?

Whenever she is raging,
She takes life away.
Haven't you seen,
Haven't you seen,
The ruins of our world?

She covers the earth with a breathtaking cloak.
The sun awakes and melts it away.
The world now opens its eyes and it sees,
The dawning of the new day.

On cold wings she's coming,
You better keep moving.
For warmth, you'll be longing.
Come on just feel it,
Don't you see it?
You better believe.

Whenever she is raging,
She takes life away.

Blinking in the morning sun
Shaking off a heavy one
Heavy like a loaded gun

Someone tell me how I feel
It's silly wrong, but vivid right
Oh, kiss me like a final meal
Yeah, kiss me like we die tonight

'Cause holy cow, I love your eyes
And only now I see the light
Yeah, lying with you half awake

If you think I wink, I did
Laugh politely at repeats
Yeah, kiss me when my lips are thin

And only now I see the light
Yeah, lying with you half awake
Stumbling over what to say
Well, anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day

A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back

And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette
And a message coming from my eyes
Says leave it alone

Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell

And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do
And the feeling coming from my bones
Says find a home

I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore

And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will think no more
And the stains coming from my blood
Tell me go back home"

At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines
Sprung from cages on Highway 9
Chrome-wheeled, fuel-injected and steppin' out over the line

Oh, baby, this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap
It's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
'Cause tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run
Yes, girl, we were

Wendy, let me in, I wanna be your friend
I wanna guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands 'cross my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run 'til we drop, and baby, we'll never go back

Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire?
'Cause, baby, I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I wanna know if love is wild
Babe, I wanna know if love is real
Oh, can you show me?

Beyond the palace
Hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard

The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in the mist
I wanna die with you, Wendy, on the street tonight
In an everlasting kiss, huh

One, two, three, four
The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight, but there's no place left to hide
Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all of the madness in my soul

Oh, someday, girl, I don't know when
We're gonna get to that place where we really wanna go
And we'll walk in the sun

Making me feel I could survive

Nowhere to run and not a guitar to play
mixed up inside and it's been raining all day
Since you went away

Ik zit hier op de snelweg met een lege tank
regen klettert op het dak
Ik zal nu wel naar huis toe moeten liften
denk aan jou bij elke stap
In de verte blijft een Transit staan
ik kom nooit meer van je los
Ik zie de Cotex in de nevel
olie vlekken op de Maas
Ik loop wel door maar ik kan nergens heen
het regent nog steeds en ik voel me zo alleen

But one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you

You can't turn back the clock
You can't turn back the tide, ain't that a shame?
Ooh, I'd like to go back one time on a rollercoaster ride
When life was just a game

No use in sitting
And thinking on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow

'Cause these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now
But some things remain
When I look and I find no change

Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

So baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

And we found love right where we are"
220,221,Numb,Linkin Park,2003,"I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I've become so tired; so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly; afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you

(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I've become so tired; so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know I may end up failing too
But I know you were just like me
With someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I've become so tired; so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there

221,222,Angel Of Death,Slayer,1986,"Auschwitz, the meaning of pain
The way that I want you to die
Slow death, immense decay
Showers that cleanse you of your life

Forced in like cattle, you run
Stripped of your life's worth
Human mice, for the Angel of Death
Four hundred thousand more to die

Angel of Death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead

Sadistic, surgeon of demise
Sadist of the noblest blood
Destroying without mercy
To benefit the Aryan race

Surgery with no anesthesia
Feel the knife pierce you intensely
Inferior, no use to mankind
Strapped down screaming out to die

Angel of Death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher
Angel of Death

Pumped with fluid, inside your brain
Pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
Burning flesh drips away
Test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil

Frigid cold, cracks your limbs
How long can you last in this frozen water burial?
Sewn together, joining heads
Just a matter of time 'til you rip yourselves apart

Millions laid out in their crowded tombs
Sickening ways to achieve the holocaust

Seas of blood, bury life
Smell your death as it burns deep inside of you
Abacinate, eyes that bleed
Praying for the end of your wide awake nightmare

Wings of pain reach out for you
His face of death staring down, your blood's running cold
Injecting cells, dying eyes
Feeding on the screams of the mutant he's creating

Pathetic harmless victims left to die
Rancid Angel of Death flying free

Angel of Death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher
Angel of Death
Angel of Death"
222,223,Still Got The Blues ,Gary Moore,1990,"Used to be so easy
To give my heart away
But I found out the hard way
There's a price you have to pay

I found out that love
Was no friend of mine
I should have known
Time after time

So long, it was so long ago
But I've still got the blues for you

Used to be so easy
To fall in love again
But I found out the hard way
It's a road that leads to pain
I found out that love
Was more than just a game
Playing to win
But you lose just the same

So long, it was so long ago
But I've still got the blues for you

So many years since I've seen your face
But here in my heart there's an empty space
Where you used to be

So long, it was so long ago
But I've still got the blues for you

Though the days come and go
There is one thing I know
I've still got the blues for you"

Oh, what you do to me
No one knows

And I realize you're mine
Indeed, a fool am I
And I realize you're mine
Indeed, a fool am I, I

I journey through the desert
Of the mind with no hope
I follow 

I drift along the ocean
Dead lifeboats in the sun
And come undone
Pleasantly caving in
I come undone

And I realize you're mine
Indeed, a fool am I
And I realize you're mine
Indeed, a fool am I, I

Heaven smiles above me
What a gift here below
But no one knows
The gift that you give to me
No one knows"

Als ik jou zie, 's avonds bij het park
De autolichten beschijnen je lichaam
Zonder ogen, zonder herinnering

Ik neem aan, dat je nooit liefde hebt gehad
Ook niet toen dat zo belangrijk voor je was
De woorden die bij jou horen, zijn goedkoper dan ik dacht
In één seconde ging het regenen vannacht

Ga die wereld uit
Eén seconde, en reis snel door die wereld uit
Ga die wereld uit
Eén seconde, en kijk goed rond in ons paradijs
En vraag niet naar de weg, want iedereen is de weg kwijt

Op zoek naar geluk, in Kronenburg park
Thuis wacht een vrouw onwetend op haar man
Ze heeft nooit iets gevoeld van zijn ontevredenheid
En alles blijft bij het oude, als hij naar huis rijdt

Ga die wereld uit
Eén seconde, en reis snel door die wereld uit
Ga die wereld uit
Eén seconde, en kijk goed rond in ons paradijs
En vraag niet naar de weg, want iedereen is de weg kwijt

En alles blijft bij het oude, als hij weer naar huis rijdt

Ga die wereld uit
Eén seconde, en reis snel door die wereld uit

Of your loneliness

Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost

Players only love you when they're playing

I keep my visions to myself

Wrap around your dreams and
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell?

It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto

People, don't you understand
The child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way

Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto

And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto

Then one night in desperation
The young man breaks the rules
He buys a gun, steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries

As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto

As her young man dies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries"

Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
And rode us all the way into New Orleans

I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
I's playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues
Windshield wipers slappin' time
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', it ain't nothin' honey, if it ain't free
And feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
You know feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun
Yeah, Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Yeah, Bobby baby kept me from the cold

One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home and I hope he finds it
But I'd trade all my tomorrows for one single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', and that's all that Bobby left me
Well feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee, yeah

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today, oh boy
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

(One)

Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late
(Huh, huh, huh, huh)

Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Ah, ah ah ah
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Ah
Ah, ah ah ah, ah ah ah

I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here, forever
You and me together, nothing is better

'Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time

Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time

Burn, oh

Let it burn, oh
Let it burn

248,249,I See Fire,Ed Sheeran,2014,"Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire then we shall all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside

And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain, I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

And if the night is burning I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as this sky is falling down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out

And I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze

I see fire
Oh you know I saw a city burning (Fire)
And I see fire
Feel the heat upon my skin (Fire)
And I see fire
Oh (Fire)

When hearts like ours meet

We have a greed with which we have agreed
And you think you have to want more than you need

Society, you're a crazy breed
I hope you're not lonely without me

When you want more than you have, you think you need

I think I need to find a bigger place
'Cause when you have more than you think, you need more space

Society, you're a crazy breed

Society, crazy indeed
Hope you're not lonely without me

There's those thinking more or less, less is more

Means for every point you make your level drops
Kinda like you're startin' from the top

The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me and I walk alone

I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, and I walk-a

My shadow's only one who walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone up there will find me
Till then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone

Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, and I walk-a

My shadow's only one who walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone up there will find me
Till then I walk alone

Misschien ben ik vanavond vroeger vrij""
Ze knikt wel van ja, maar zij kent mij

Nu sta ik voor je
Ik ben weer blijven hangen in de kroeg
Zo'n nacht, ze weet 't, heb ik nooit genoeg
""Hoe was 't?"", dat was alles wat ze vroeg, wat ze vroeg

Want zij gelooft in mij
Zij ziet toekomst in ons allebei
Ze vraagt nooit ""Maak je voor mij eens vrij""
Want ze weet: dit gaat voorbij

Ik schrijf m'n eigen lied
Totdat iemand mij ontdekt en ziet
Tot eenieder van mijn songs geniet
Ze vertrouwt op mij, ze gelooft in mij

Ik zal wachten
Tot de tijd dat ieder mij herkent
En je trots kan zijn op je eigen vent
Op straat zullen ze zeggen: ""Die Hazes is bekend""

Zolang we dromen
Van 't geluk dat ergens op ons wacht
Dan vergeet je snel weer deze nacht
Zij vertrouwt op mij, dat is m'n kracht

Want zij gelooft in mij
Zij ziet toekomst in ons allebei

255,256,Testament,Boudewijn De Groot,1967,"Na tweeëntwintig jaren in dit leven
Maak ik een testament op van mijn jeugd
Niet dat ik geld of goed heb weg te geven
Voor slimme jongen heb ik nooit gedeugd

Maar ik heb nog wel wat mooie idealen
Goed van snit hoewel ze uit de mode zijn
Wie ze hebben wil, die mag ze komen halen
Vooral jonge mensen vinden ze wel fijn

Aan mijn broertje dat zo graag wil gaan studeren
Laat ik met plezier 't adres na van mijn kroeg
Waar ik te veel dronk om een vrouw te imponeren
En daarna de klappen kreeg waarom ik vroeg

En dan heb ik nog een stuk of wat vriendinnen
Die welopgevoed en zeer verstandig zijn
En waarmee je dus geen donder kunt beginnen
Maar misschien krijgt iemand anders ze wel klein

Voor mijn neefje zijn mijn onvervulde wensen
Wel wat kinderlijk maar ach ze zijn zo diep
Ik behoorde immer tot die groep van mensen
Voor wie 't geluk toch altijd harder liep

Aan mijn vrienden laat ik gaarne het vermogen
Om verliefd te worden op een meisjeslach
Zelf ben ik helaas een keer te veel bedrogen
Maar wie het eens proberen wil, die mag

M'n vriendinnetje, ik laat jou alle nachten
Dat ik tranen om jouw ontrouw heb gestort
Maar onthoud het wel,ik zal geduldig wachten
Tot ik lach omdat jij ook belazerd wordt

En de leraar die mij altijd placht te dreigen
""Jongen, jij komt nog op het verkeerde pad!""
Kan tevreden zijn en hoeft niets meer te krijgen
Dat wil zeggen hij heeft toch gelijk gehad

Voor mijn ouders is het album met de plaatjes
Die zo vals getuigen van een blijde jeugd
Maar ze tonen niet de zouteloze praatjes
Die een kind opvoeden in eer en deugd

En verder krijgen z'alle dwaze dingen terug
Die ze mij te veel geleerd hebben die tijd
Ze kunnen mij tenslotte ook niet dwingen
Groot te worden zonder diep berouw en spijt

En dan heb ik ook nog wat goede vrienden
Maar die hebben al genoeg van mij gehad
Dus ik gun ze nu het loon dat ze verdienden
Alle drank die ze van mij hebben gejat

Verder niets, er zijn alleen nog een paar dingen
Die ik houd omdat geen mens er iets aan heeft
Dat zijn mijn goede jeugdherinneringen
Die neem je mee zolang je verder leeft"
256,257,Your Song,Elton John,1971,"It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but, boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind, while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green, or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world"

To get your prescription filled
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
And, man, did he look pretty ill

We decided that we would have a soda
My favorite flavor, cherry red
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was ""dead""
I said to him

She can wound with her eyes
And she can ruin your faith with her casual lies
And she only reveals what she wants you to see
She hides like a child
But she's always a woman to me

She can lead you to love
She can take you or leave you
She can ask for the truth
But she'll never believe you
And she'll take what you give her as long as it's free
Yeah, she steals like a thief but she's always a woman to me

Oh, she takes care of herself
She can wait if she wants
She's ahead of her time
Oh, and she never gives out
And she never gives in
She just changes her mind

And she'll promise you more than the Garden of Eden
Then she'll carelessly cut you
And laugh while you're bleedin'
But she'll bring out the best

And she can't be convicted
She's earned her degree
And the most she will do
Is throw shadows at you
But she's always a woman to me"

Maar in het zuiden wacht een vrouw nog steeds op mij alleen
Ze heeft flessen vol tequila en flessen vol gin
En dan neem ik m'n gitaar mee en m'n gouden ring
Er zijn vliegtuigstoelen, miljoenen bijbedoelingen en bovendien zijn er
Limousines en er zijn leugens over sterren die we toch nooit zien

Misschien, neem ik Spanje als besluit
Laat m'n schepen achter
Ik ga er stiekem tussenuit
Een vluchtweg naar een nieuw begin

Well, hop on my Choo-Choo
I'll be your engine driver in a bunny suit
If you dress me up in pink and white
We may be a little fuzzy
Talk about it later tonight
She's my angel
She's a little better than the one that used to be with me
Cos she likes to scream at me
Man it's a miracle that's she's not living up in a tree

I may take a holiday in Spain
Leave my wings behind me
Drive this little girl insane
And fly away to someone new

Everybody's gone
They left the television screaming that the radio's on
M'n schoenen zijn gejat
Maar ik hoef niet meer naar buiten, want er is nog wel wat

Well, happy New Year's baby
We could probably fix it, if we clean it up all day
Or we could simply pack our bags
En gaan meteen naar Barcelona, want we moeten hier weg

Misschien neem ik Spanje als besluit
Laat m'n schepen achter
Ik ga er stiekem tussenuit
Een vluchtweg naar een nieuw begin

Ik neem als Spanje als besluit
En laat m'n schepen achter
Ik ga er stiekem tussenuit

Geef me de tijd om mezelf terug te vinden
Ik maak alles goed met wat er over blijft

Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else

I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly loss, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel

Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me but now he's gone

No one but me can save myself but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try

Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
Goodbye"

With stars to fill my dream
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been

To sit with elders of a gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Who talk of days for which they sit and wait
When all will be revealed

Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Sounds caress my ear
Though not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear

Whoa-oh-hoh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh

Ooh, oh, baby, I've been flying, no, yeah
Mama cares, ain't no denying
Oh, ooh yes, I've been flying
My mama, ain't no denying, no denying, no

Oh, all I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find
Where I've been, ah-ah, ah-ah

Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Who hid the path that led me to that place
With yellow desert screen

My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that blows high in June
When moving through Kashmir

Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear

Und die Welt hinter mir wird langsam klein
Doch die Welt vor mir ist für mich gemacht
Ich weiß, sie wartet und ich hol sie ab!
Ich hab den Tag auf meiner Seite, ich hab Rückenwind
Ein Frauenchor am Straßenrand, der für mich singt
Ich lehne mich zurück und guck ins tiefe Blau
Schließ' die Augen und lauf einfach geradeaus

Und am Ende der Straße steht ein Haus am See
Orangenbaumblätter liegen auf dem Weg
Ich hab zwanzig Kinder, meine Frau ist schön
Alle komm'n vorbei, ich brauch nie rauszugehen
(Im Traum gesehen, das Haus am See
Yeah, yeah)

Ich suche neues Land mit unbekannten Straßen
Fremde Gesichter und keiner kennt mein'n Namen!
Alles gewinnen beim Spiel mit gezinkten Karten
Alles verlieren, Gott hat einen harten linken Haken
Ich grabe Schätze aus im Schnee und Sand
Und Frauen rauben mir jeden Verstand
Doch irgendwann werd ich vom Glück verfolgt
Und komm zurück mit beiden Taschen voll Gold
Ich lad' die alten Vögel und Verwandten ein
Und alle fang'n vor Freude an zu wein'n
Wir grillen, die Mamas kochen und wir saufen Schnaps
Und feiern eine Woche jede Nacht

Head while I'm drivin', I'm drivin'
Soft lips are open, your knuckles are pale
Feels like you're dyin', you're dyin'

You, your sex is on fire

Hot as a fever, rattlin' bones
I could just taste it, taste it
If it's not forever, if it's just tonight

And we are going to Graceland

And my traveling companion is nine years old
He is the child of my first marriage

As if I didn't know my own bed
As if I'd never noticed

Who calls herself the human trampoline
And sometimes when I'm falling, flying

And everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody feels the wind blow

There's some part of me wants to see Graceland
And I may be obliged to defend
Every love, every ending

284,285,Do I Wanna Know,Arctic Monkeys,2013,"Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift
The type that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow
And I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open
And if so I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp
Of trying to kiss you
But I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

(Do I wanna know)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay

To the way you move

You're like a dream come true

But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?

'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized

We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
'Cause nobody told me
That you'd be here

And I swear you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me

You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were

It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there

And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care?

It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Man, I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there, baby
I could use just a little help

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Messages keep getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place
I check my look in the mirror
Wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face

Man, I ain't getting nowhere
I'm just livin' in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby, I just know that there is

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on, baby, the laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up alright
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby, I'm just about starving tonight

I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sittin' 'round here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on, baby, gimme just one look

You can't start a fire
Sittin' 'round crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You can't start a fire
Worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

288,289,Worn Down Piano,Mark & Clark Band,1977,"Each Tuesday morning, they'd all stand in line
The auction would open promptly at nine
The gavel came down on the auctioneer's block
And the bidding began on a grandfather's clock

Next up for bids in the rear of the room
A piano worn down and a bit out of tune
Who'll start the bidding?, the auctioneer cried
No voices rang out, so just put it aside

Shouts filled the room and the auction went on
When the cries of the crowd were stopped by a song
Everyone turned to the rear of the room
To that worn down piano, a bit out of tune

Oh the days long ago when the crowds came around
To hear that piano ring out with sound
But the crowds have all gone and the symphony's through
And the piano cries out: 'let me play once for you'

A man with a torn coat and a hole in one shoe
Sat playing the song that nobody knew
The music rang out and that song filled the room
From that worn down piano, a bit out of tune

Then from the crowd a man shouted a bid
One thousand dollars for that piano I'll give
Two thousand, Three thousand, and the bidding went on
As the man in the torn coat kept playing that song

The bidding grew tense each bid more and more
Till the five thousand figure rang out from the floor
The man in the torn coat just sat there and stared
Playing that song as if no one were there

Oh the days long ago when the crowds came around
To hear that piano ring out with sound
But the crowds have all gone and the symphony's through
And the piano cries out: let me play once for you

The man in the torn coat played as if to say
I too want you, piano but I've nothing to pay
I'd give all I own if you could be mine
But all I can bid is this bottle of wine

The sound of the gavel rang out through the air
The auctioneer cried: Top that bid if you dare
Just give him the piano, maestro play on
But where has the man, in the torn coat gone?

It's a quarter past five and the bidding is done
Everything's sold and now leave one by one
The auction is over and left in that room
Is that worn down piano, still a bit out of tune

Oh the days long ago when the crowds came around
To hear that piano ring out with sound
But the crowds have all gone and the symphony's through
And the piano cries out: let me once play for you"

Voor altijd, voor altijd en een leven lang, 't was
Zo stil, dat iedereen het voelde in z'n lijf
Geen pen die ooit nog dit gevoel beschrijven kan

Zo stil dat alle klokken zwegen
Ja, de tijd stond onbewegelijk
Zo stil en zo verloren ging je weg
Zo stil en zo verloren ging je weg

Ik heb zoveel gehoord en toch komt niets meer bij me aan
En dat is dus waarom ik 's nachts niet slapen kan
Al zing ik duizend liedjes over dit gemis
En nog zou ik niet weten waarom toch dit gevoel voor altijd is

Zo hard, de uren na de klap dreunde zo na
Dat niets nog te bevatten en begrijpen was, 't was
Zo hard dat alles wat we dachten ons alleen maar leegte bracht
Zo moe en zo verslagen waren wij
Nu de stilte bij ons was in plaats van jij

Ik heb zoveel gehoord en toch komt niets meer bij me aan
En dat is dus waarom ik 's nachts niet slapen kan
Al zing ik duizend liedjes over dit gemis
En nog zou ik niet weten waarom toch dit gevoel voor altijd is

Zo stil, hoewel ik je nog iedere dag mis
Waar je nu ook zijn mag, echt, 't is
Me helder dat stilte nu je vriend geworden is

Ik heb zoveel gehoord en toch komt niets meer bij me aan
En dat is dus waarom ik 's nachts niet slapen kan
Al zing ik duizend liedjes over dit gemis
Ik zou 't echt niet weten, ik zou 't echt niet weten

Ik heb zoveel gehoord en toch komt niets meer bij me aan
En dat is dus waarom ik 's nachts niet slapen kan
Al zing ik duizend liedjes over dit gemis
En nog zou ik niet weten waarom toch dit gevoel voor altijd is"

And down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change

The world is closing in
And did you ever think
That we could be so close like brothers

The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change

Walking down the street
And distant memories
Are buried in the past forever

It's just a leap of time
So close into my mind
The heart into the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change

The wind of change blows straight
Into the face of time
Like a storm wind that will ring
The freedom bell for peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to say

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change"
294,295,Don't Give Up,Peter Gabriel & Kate Bush,1986,"In this proud land we grew up strong
We were wanted all along
I was taught to fight, taught to win
I never thought I could fail

No fight left, or so it seems
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted
I've changed my face, I've changed my name
But no one wants you when you lose

Don't give up
'Cause you have friends
Don't give up
You're not beaten yet
Don't give up
I know you can make it good

Though I saw it all around
Never thought that I could be affected
Thought that we'd be last to go
It is so strange the way things turn

Drove the night toward my home
The place that I was born, on the lakeside
As daylight broke, I saw the earth
The trees had burned down to the ground

Don't give up
You still have us
Don't give up
We don't need much of anything
Don't give up
'Cause somewhere there's a place where we belong
Rest your head
You worry too much
It's gonna be all right
When times get rough
You can fall back on us
Don't give up
Please don't give up

Got to walk out of here
I can't take any more
Gonna stand on that bridge
Keep my eyes down below
Whatever may come
And whatever may go
That river's flowing
That river's flowing

Moved on to another town
Tried hard to settle down
For every job, so many men
So many men no one needs

Don't give up
'Cause you have friends
Don't give up
You're not the only one
Don't give up
No reason to be ashamed
Don't give up
You still have us
Don't give up now
We're proud of who you are
Don't give up
You know it's never been easy
Don't give up
'Cause I believe there's a place
There's a place where we belong

Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up

Can you imagine when this race is won
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music's played by the, the mad man

Do you really want to live forever, forever, or never?
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever? Forever young

Some are a melody and some are the beat
Sooner or later, they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young?

It's so hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
Youth is like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever

So many adventures couldn't happen today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams swinging out of the blue
Oh, let them come true

Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on he's known
A vow unto his own
That never from this day
His will they'll take away

To running all of his

Throughout his life the same
He's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win
A tired man they see no longer cares

To die regretfully

305,306,The Cave,Mumford & Sons,2010,"It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind

The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

'Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind

So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say
'Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again"
306,307,Echoes,Pink Floyd,1971,"Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves
In labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant time
Comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

And no-one showed us to the land
And no-one knows the wheres or whys
But something stirs and something tries
Now starts to climb towards the light

Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can

And no-one calls us to move on
And no-one forces down our eyes
No-one speaks and no-one tries
No-one flies around the sun

Cloudless everyday you fall upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

And no-one sings me lullabies
And no-one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky"

Je roept me
Je hoort me
Je redt en verstoort me
Gelooft me,
Berooft me
Verstikt en verdooft me

Je ademt en leeft me
Siddert en beeft me
Vertrouwt me
Beschouwt me als mens
En weerhoudt me
Van bozige dromen
Die op komen dagen
De eenzame vragen van eindig geluk

Met je krullen als nacht
Hoe je praat, hoe je lacht
Hoe je stem zo dichtbij als een engel verzacht
In mijn dromen doorstromen
Oneindige leegtes
Je remt me
Je temt me
Je roert en beweegt me

Ik mis je
Ik mis je
Ik grijp je
Ik gris je
Ik wil je
Bespeel je
Ik roer en beveel je
Om bij me te blijven
In donkere nachten
Om niet meer te smachten naar jou

Laat me los
Ik moet nu alleen
En houdt me vast als het nodig is
In gedachten
Ik zoek je in alles om me heen
Maar al denk ik soms dat het zo beter is
Kan ik het niet helpen dat ik je soms mis

Ik smoor je
Bevroor je
Verlos, en verloor je
Weg naar een andere plek maar ik hoor je
Omarm je
Verwarm je
Ik zie je en voel je
Ik aai je
Ik streel je
Ik knuffel en kroel je

Je rijpt me
Begrijpt me
Verwart en misleidt me
Het schrikt me soms af
Hoeveel ik op je lijk nu

Mijn glimlach
Mijn tranen
Mijn liefde
Mijn beleven
Het spijt me van alles
Kom help en bevrijd me

En laat me los
Ik kan het alleen
Maar houd me vast als het nodig is
In gedachten
En ik vind je in alles om me heen

Maar al denk ik soms dat het zo beter is
Kan ik het niet helpen dat ik je mis

Ik kus je
Ik sus je
Ik doof en ik blus je
Je blijft heel dichtbij me
Maar in mijn hoofd rust je"

Yeah, I only smoke weed when I need to,
And I need to get some rest. Yo, where's the cess?
I confess, I burned a hole in the mattress,
Yes yes it was me, I plead guilty,
And at the count of three I pull back the duvet,
Make my way to the refrigerator,
One dry potato inside, no lie,
Not even bread, jam,
When the light above my head went bam.

I can't see, something's all over me,
Greasy. Insomnia; please release me,
And let me dream about making mad love on the heath,
Tearing off tights with my teeth,
But there's no relief,
I'm wide awake in my kitchen,
It's black and I'm lonely.
Oh if I could only get some sleep?
Creaky noises make my skin creep,
I need to get some sleep.
I can't get no sleep."

And sitting in the long grass in summer
Keepin' warm
I'll remember it

We were so young then
We thought that everything
We could possibly do was right
Then we moved
Stolen from our very eyes
And I wondered where you went to
Tell me when did the light die
You will rise
You'll return
The phoenix from the flame
You will learn
You will rise
You'll return
Being what you are
There is no other Troy
For you to burn

Does she need you like I do?
Do you love her?

I know you're always telling me
That you love me
Just sometimes I wonder
If I should believe
Oh, I love you
God, I love you
I'd kill a dragon for you
I'll die
But I will rise
And I will return
The Phoenix from the flame
I have learned
I will rise
And you'll see me return
Being what I am
There is no other Troy
For me to burn

And you should've left the light on
You should've left the light on

And you'd never have known
And I wouldn't have pulled you tighter
No I wouldn't have pulled you close
I wouldn't have screamed
No I can't let you go
If the door wasn't closed
No I wouldn't have pulled you to me
No I wouldn't have kissed your face
You wouldn't have begged me to hold you
If we hadn't been there in the first place
Ah but I know you wanted me to be there oh oh
Every look that you threw told me so
But you should've left the light on
You should've left the light on

You're still a lawyer

314,315,The Day Before You Came,ABBA,1982,"I must have left my house at eight, because I always do 
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due 
I must have read the morning paper going into town 
And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned 

I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine 
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed 
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so 
The usual place, the usual bunch 

And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained 
The day before you came 

I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two 
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue 
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day 
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away 

At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule 
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school 
The train back home again 
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then 

Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within it's usual frame 
The day before you came 

I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so 
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go 
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV 
There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see 

I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten 
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then 
I must have read a while 
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style 

It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim 
The day before you came 

And turning out the light 
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night 
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain 
The day before you came"

Is there somewhere you can tell me?""

He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you, you and me in paradise
Think about it

She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk, but she's trying

Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice
It's just another day for you, you and me in paradise
Just think about it

Oh, Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do?
Oh, Lord, there must be something you can say

You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
'Cause she didn't fit in there

Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice
It's just another day for you, you and me in paradise
Just think about it, mmm hmm
Think about it

It's just another day for you and me in paradise
It's just another day for you and me in paradise

When she's ten feet tall

And if you go chasing rabbits
And you know you're going to fall
Tell 'em a hookah-smoking caterpillar
Has given you the call
He called Alice
When she was just small

When the men on the chessboard
Get up and tell you where to go
And you've just had some kind of mushroom
And your mind is moving low
Go ask Alice
I think she'll know

When logic and proportion
Have fallen sloppy dead
And the White Knight is talking backwards
And the Red Queen's off with her head
Remember what the dormouse said
Feed your head
Feed your head"

I'd be inclined
To believe they never would

Look at the night
And it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Well take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Now take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do 
And that's what I've got to face

Take a good look at me now 
'Cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
It's the chance I've got to take

Take a look at me now"

Shying away

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
I'm odds and ends, but I'm me
Stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is okay
Say after me
""It's no better to be safe than sorry""

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)

In a day or two

Only fools rush in
But I can't help
Falling in love with you

Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
If I can't help
Falling in love with you

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help
Falling in love with you

Like a river flows

322,323,Demons,Imagine Dragons,2014,"When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all and the blood's run stale

I want to hide the truth, I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call, it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Don't want to let you down but I am hellbound
Though this is all for you, don't want to hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I want to save that light
I can't escape this now unless you show me how

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide"

She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner

If the Heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week

We were born sick
You heard them say it

My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you

I was born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well
A-amen, amen, amen

My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine lookin' high horse

What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death

There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human, only then I am clean

Oh oh
Amen, amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide

A long long time ago

Oh no, not me
We never lost control
You're face, to face
With the man who sold the world

And made my way back home

For years and years I roamed

We walked a million hills

Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
And you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say


Breathe Reprise

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired<sup id=""note1"" style=""line-height:0;"">[1]</sup>

Calls the faithful to their knees

Spend your days biting your own neck

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I my dear?

But it was not your fault but mine

340,341,Castle On The Hill,Ed Sheeran,2017,"When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
Tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here, made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know, I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way, driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old smoking hand rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when we found
Weekend jobs when we got paid we'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way, driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
Ones already on his second wife
Ones just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill"

343,344,De Vlieger,André Hazes,1977,"M'n zoon was gisteren jarig
Hij werd acht jaar oud, m'n schat
Hij vroeg aan mij een vlieger
En die heeft hij ook gehad

Naar z'n bal, z'n fiets, z'n treinen
Nee, daar keek hij niet naar om
Want z'n vlieger was hem alles
Alleen wist ik niet waarom

En toen de andere morgen, zei hij:
""Vader, ga je mee?
De wind die is nu gunstig
Dus ik neem m'n vlieger mee""

In z'n ene hand een vlieger
In de andere een brief
Ik kon het niet begrijpen
Maar toen zei m'n zoontje lief

Ik heb hier een brief voor m'n moeder
Die hoog in de hemel is
Deze brief bind ik vast aan m'n vlieger
Tot zij hem ontvangt, zij die ik mis

En als zij dan leest hoeveel ik van haar hou
Dat ik niet kan wennen aan die andere vrouw
Ik heb hier een brief voor m'n moeder
Die hoog in de hemel is

Ik heb hier een brief voor m'n moeder
Die hoog, in de hemel is
Deze brief bind ik vast aan m'n vlieger
Tot zij 'm ontvangt, zij die ik mis

Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

You used to captivate me
By your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

346,347,A Horse With No Name,America,1972,"On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings

The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

Lalala...

After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed

And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

Lalala...

After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings

The ocean is a desert with it's life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

Lalala..."

348,349,Jesus To A Child,George Michael,1996,"Kindness in your eyes
I guess you heard me cry
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
I'm blessed I know
Heaven sent and heaven stole
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
And what have I learned from all this pain
I thought I never feel the same about anyone or anything again
But now I know

When you find a love
When you know that it exists
Then the lover that you miss
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights
When you've been loved
When you know it holds such bliss
Then the lover that you kissed
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight

Sadness in my eyes
No one guessed and no one tried
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
Loveless and cold
With your last breath you saved my soul
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
And what have I learned from all these tears
I've waited for you all those years
Then just when it began he took your love away
But I still say

When you find a love
When you know that it exists
Then the lover that you miss
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights
When you've been loved
When you know it holds such bliss
Then the lover that you kissed
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight

So the words you could not say
I'll sing them for you
And the love we would have made
I'll make it for two
For every single memory
Has become a part of me
You will always be my love
Well I've been loved so I know just what love is
And the lover that I kissed is always by my side
Oh the lover I still miss... was Jesus to a child"

Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?

It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again

Way down in the valley tonight
There's a man in the shadows with a gun in his eye
And a blade shining oh so bright

There's evil in the air and there's thunder in sky
And a killer's on the bloodshot streets
Oh, and down in the tunnel where the deadly are rising
Oh, I swear I saw a young boy down in the gutter
He was starting to foam in the heat

Oh baby, you're the only thing in this whole world
That's pure and good and right
And wherever you are and wherever you go
There's always gonna be some light

But I gotta get out, I gotta break it out now
Before the final crack of dawn
So we gotta make the most of our one night together

We'll both be so alone

Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone when the morning comes
When the night is over
Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone, gone, gone
Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone when the morning comes

But when the day is done and the sun goes down
And the moonlight's shining through
Then like a sinner before the gates of heaven
I'll come crawling on back to you

I'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram
On a silver black Phantom bike
When the metal is hot and the engine is hungry
And we're all about to see the light

Nothing ever grows in this rotten old hole
Everything is stunted and lost
And nothing really rocks and nothing really rolls
And nothing's ever worth the cost

And I know that I'm damned if I never get out
And maybe I'm damned if I do
But with every other beat I've got left in my heart
You know I'd rather be damned with you

Well, if I gotta be damned, you know I wanna be damned
Dancing through the night with you
Well, if I gotta be damned, you know I wanna be damned

I'll come crawling on back to you

Oh, I can see myself tearing up the road
Faster than any other boy has ever gone
And my skin is raw but my soul is ripe
And no one's gonna stop me now
I'm gonna make my escape
But I can't stop thinking of you
And I never see the sudden curve till it's way too late
And I never see the sudden curve till it's way too late

Then I'm dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun
Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike
And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell

Still beating
Breaking out of my body and flying away

Run me like a race horse
Hold me like a rip cord

Don't wanna be the parenthetical
Hypothetical, working onto something that I'm proud of
Out of the box an epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost

I'm an apostrophe, I'm just a symbol to reminds you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece and yet I'm half diseased
And when I am deceased

At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave the body of my soul to be a part of me
I do what it takes

I'm gonna bathe myself in a wishin' well
Pretty scars from cigarettes
I... never will forget, I... never will forget

I'm still afraid to be alone
Wish that moon would follow me home

Thinking it will come back and reach my home

It's like a distant face
It's like a shadow on my wall
Something that I can't touch
A heavenly past that calls
Shelter of my mind hides my love and my tear

Wipe away the teardrop from your eye
You're lying safe in bed
It was all a bad dream spinning in your head
Your mind tricked you to feel the pain
Of someone close to you leaving the game of life

So here it is, another chance
Wide awake you face the day
Your dream is over
Or has it just begun?

There's a place I like to hide
A doorway that I run through in the night
Relax child, you were there
But only didn't realize and you were scared
It's a place where you will learn
To face your fears, retrace the years
And ride the whims of your mind

Commanding in another world
Suddenly you hear and see
This magic new dimension

I will be watching over you
I am gonna help you see it through
I will protect you in the night
I am smiling next to you in silent lucidity

I can't do this
Visualize your dream
Record it in the present tense
Put it into a permanent form
If you persist in your efforts
You can achieve dream control
Dream control
How's that then, better?
Help me

If you open your mind for me
You won't rely on open eyes to see
The walls you built within
Come tumbling down and a new world will begin
Living twice at once, you learn
You're safe from the pain in the dream domain
A soul set free to fly

A round trip journey in your head
Master of illusion, can you realize
Your dream's alive
You can be the guide but

I will be watching over you
I am gonna help you see it through
I will protect you in the night
I am smiling next to you"

Transistor radio

Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding 'hind a rainbow's wall

I've travelled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each chartered course
Each careful step along the by-way
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all
And I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh no. Oh no, not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

Yes, it was my way"

I can't do everything, but I'll do anything for you
I can't do anything 'cept be in love with you

And all I do is miss you, and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat, the bad company
And all I do is kiss you, through the bars of a rhyme

And you
Shook me all night long
Yeah, you
Shook me all night long

Working double time 
On the seduction line
She was one of a kind
She's just mine all mine

Wanted no applause
Just another course
Made a meal out of me
And come back for more

Had to cool me down
To take another round
Now I'm back in the ring
To take another swing

That the walls were shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it 

And you
Shook me all night long
Yeah, you
Shook me all night long

And knocked me out, I said, you
Shook me all night long
You had me shaking and you
Shook me all night long

Yeah, you shook me
When you took me

You really took me and you
Shook me all night long
Oh-oh-oh you
Shook me all night long

Yeah yeah, you
Shook me all night long
You really got me and you
Shook me all night long

Yeah, you shook me
Yeah, you shook me
All night long"

Were in my life just to get high on

All the channels that have broken down

Niets dan wat ik hoor en zie, niets
dan wat ik lees
Ik geen geen andere landen, zelfs al
ben ik er geweest
Grote steden ken ik niet
Behalve uit de boeken, behalve van T.V.
Ik ken geen andere stad dan de stad
waarin ik leef
Zij stuurt me kaarten uit Madrid
En uit Moskou komt een brief
Met de prachtigste verhalen
Oh God, wat is ze lief
Gisteren uit Lissabon ""ik mis je"" en
een zoen
Vandaag uit Praag een kattebel, want
er is zoveel te doen
En morgen, als de postbode mijn huis
weer heeft gevonden
Dan stort ze mijn hart vol met al het
liefs uit Londen
Van de wereld weet ik niets
Niets dan wat ik hoor en zie, niets dan
wat ik voel
Ik leef van dag tot dag, zonder vrees


en zonder doel
Verre landen ken ik niet
Behalve uit mijn atlas, die droom ik
elke nacht
Maar ik droom alleen de landen waar
ze ooit aan me dacht
Als een mooi en groot geloof
Aan de muur van mijn gedachten
Hangt een wereldkaart te wachten
Tot ze terugkomt
Met haar reizen in mijn hoofd
Steek ik vlaggen in de aarde
Dezelfde kleur, dezelfde waarde
Maar zij stuurt me kaarten uit Madrid
En uit Moskou komt een brief
Met de prachtigste verhalen
Oh God, wat is ze lief
Gisteren uit Lissabon ""ik mis je"" en

Ik heb vannacht gekeken en beleefd
Hoe geen vrouw ooit terugkrijgt wat ze geeft
Er is geen macht ter wereld die niet vroeg of laat opzij trapt
Ik heb zojuist gekeken en beleefd

Ik heb zojuist gedronken en gezien
Hoe jij van mij nooit krijgt wat je verdient
Als weer één die altijd vooruit en daarom nooit opzij kijkt
Ik heb zojuist gekeken en gezien

Blauw, blauw, blauw
Keer ik terug naar jou

Boven het vlakke land trilt stil de warme lucht
Hey, iemand slaat soms onverwacht maar zeker op de vlucht
Alarmfase 2 is hier nauwelijks nog berucht

Maar men weet het niet
en zwijgt van wat men hoort en ziet

Hier aan de kust, de Zeeuwse kust
Waar de mensen onbewust zin in mosselfeesten krijgen
en van eten slechts nog zwijgen
als ze zat zijn en voldaan
Dan weer rustig slapen gaan

Hier aan de kust, de Zeeuwse kust
Waarin ieder onbewust in het Duits wordt aan gesproken
Waar de ketting is gebroken
en alle schepen zijn verbrand
Maar er is niets aan de hand

Vlissingen ademt zwaar en moedeloos vanacht
De haven is verlaten want er is nog maar 1 vracht
Die moet in het donker buiten gaas worden gebracht
Gedenk de goede tijden van zuiverheid en kracht

Maar men weet het niet
en zwijgt van wat men hoort en ziet

Hier aan de kust, de Zeeuwse kust
Waar de zomer onbewust met een rotgang wordt genoten
en waar wild en ""onverdroten""
iedereen zijn gang kan gaan
tot men zat is en voldaan

Hier aan de kust, de Zeeuwse kust
waar de liefde van lust steeds maar weer zal gaan verliezen
omdat ze nooit kan kiezen
tussen goed en niet zo kwaad
maar dat is zoals het gaat

Hier aan de kust...."

Now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell

They've seen places beyond my land
And they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand

And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings

Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze

High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

As all good friends we talk all night
And we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything

There's no limit to what I feel
We climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real?

Is it true I'm an eagle?
Is it true I can spread my wings?

Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky (I'm an eagle)
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze

High, high
What a feeling to fly (What a feeling)
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings

Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky (I'm an eagle)
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze

High, high-igh
What a feeling to fly (What a feeling)
Over mountains and forests and seas

High, high
I'm a bird in the sky (I'm an eagle)

But you'll never know

But it is useless to ask why.
Cannot control her;
She goes her own way.

Until the end of time.
She gives and she takes.

She rules,
Until the end of time.

And all the choices that we make.
We are only passing through,
On her way.

Believing that their soul lives on.

Thoughts I can't define
My heart is racing and the night goes on

I can almost hear a laugh
Coming from your photograph
Funny how a look can share a thousand meanings

Well-intended lies
Contemplating alibis
Is it really you or is it me I'm blaming

A distant memory
Flashes over me
Even though you're gone I feel you deep inside

Dance beneath the light with that look in your eyes

I can't stop loving you
Time passes quickly and chances are few
I won't stop 'til I'm through loving you, girl

There's a window in the heart
I've tried to look through from the start
You're never really sure what someone else is thinking

Someone's broken something new
Another altered point of view
Just a certain someone's conscience playing

I held it in my hand
I did not understand
What lives inside the wind that cries her name

Tried to catch a shooting star
What seems so close can't be that far
I'm living in a dream that's never ending

Dance beneath the light with that look in your eyes

I can't stop loving you
Time passes quickly and chances are few
I won't stop 'til I'm through loving you, girl

Oh, dancin' with that look that's in your eyes

I can't stop loving you
Time passes quickly and chances are few
I won't stop 'til I'm through loving you, girl

I can't stop loving you
Time passes quickly and chances are few
I won't stop 'til I'm through loving you

Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane, there is a fireman with an hour glass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies in summer
Meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies

And you know she's half crazy, but that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her
Then she gets you on her wavelength and she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind

And Jesus was a sailor, when he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain, only drowning men could see him
He said: ""All men will be sailors then, until the sea shall free them""
But he himself was broken long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom, like a stone

And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind

Now Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river
She's wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey on our Lady of the Harbor
And she shows you where to look, among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love and they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind"

I'm stuck in Folsom Prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby, my mama told me, ""Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns""
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee snd smokin' big cigars
Well, I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin', and that's what tortures me

Well, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away"
396,397,Vienna,Ultravox,1981,"We walked in the cold air
Freezing breath on a window pane
Lying and waiting
A man in the dark in a picture frame
So mystic and soulful
A voice reaching out in a piercing cry
It stays with you until

The feeling has gone, only you and I
It means nothing to me
This means nothing to me
Oh, Vienna

The music is weaving
Haunting notes, pizzicato strings
The rhythm is calling
Alone in the night as the daylight brings
A cool, empty silence
The warmth of your hand and a cold grey sky
It fades to the distance

The image has gone, only you and I
It means nothing to me
This means nothing to me
Oh, Vienna

This means nothing to me
This means nothing to me
Oh, Vienna"
397,398,Verdronken Vlinder,Boudewijn De Groot,1966,"Zo te sterven op het water met je vleugels van papier
Zomaar drijven, na het vliegen in de wolken drijf je hier
Met je kleuren die vervagen
Zonder zoeken zonder vragen
Eindelijk voor altijd rusten
En de bloemen die je kuste
Gleuren die je hebt geweten
Alles kan je nu vergeten
Op het water wieg je heen en weer
Zo te sterven op het water met je vleugels van papier

Als een vlinder die toch vliegen kan tot in de blauwe lucht
Als een vlinder altijd vrij en voor het leven op de vlucht
Wil ik sterven op het water
Maar dat is een zorg van later
Ik wil nu als vlinder vliegen
Op de bloemen , blaren vliegen
Maar zo hoog kan ik niet komen
Dus ik vlieg maar in mijn dromen
Altijd ben ik voor het leven op de vlucht
Als een vlinder die toch vliegen kan tot in de blauwe lucht

Om te leven dacht ik je zou een vlinder moeten zijn
Om te vliegen heel ver weg van alle leed en alle pijn
Maar ik heb niet langer hinder van jaloersheid op een vlinder
Als zelfs vlinders moeten sterven laat ik niet mijn vreugd bederven
Ik kan zonder vliegen leven
Wat zou ik nog langer geven
Om een vlinder die verdronken is in mij
Om te leven hoef ik echt geen vlinder meer te zijn"
398,399,Feel,Robbie Williams,2002,"Come and hold my hand
I wanna contact the living
Not sure I understand
This role I've been given

I sit and talk to God
And he just laughs at my plans
My head speaks a language
I don't understand

I just wanna feel real love
Fill the home that I live in
'Cause I got too much life
Running through my veins
Going to waste

I don't wanna die
But I ain't keen on living either
Before I fall in love
I'm preparing to leave her

Scare myself to death
That's why I keep on running
Before I've arrived
I can see myself coming

I just wanna feel real love
Fill the home that I live in
'Cause I got too much life
Running through my veins
Going to waste

And I need to feel real love
In a life ever after
I cannot give it up

I just wanna feel real love
Fill the home that I live in
I got too much love
Running through my veins
To go to waste

I just wanna feel real love
In a life ever after
There's a hole in my soul
You can see it in my face
It's a real big place

Come and hold my hand
I wanna contact the living

Not sure I understand
Not sure I understand

400,401,Love Will Tear Us Apart,Joy Division,1980,"When routine bites hard and ambitions are low
And resentment rides high but emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways, taking different roads

Then love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

Why is the bedroom so cold? You've turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed? Our respect runs so dry
Yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives

But love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

You cry out in your sleep, all my failings exposed
And there's a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold
Just that something so good just can't function no more

But love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again"

403,404,The Whole Of The Moon,Waterboys,1986,"I pictured a rainbow
You held it in your hands
I had flashes
But you saw the plan
I wandered out in the world for years
While you just stayed in your room
I saw the crescent
You saw the whole of the moon
The whole of the moon

You were there at the turnstiles
With the wind at your heels
You stretched for the stars
And you know how it feels
To reach too high
Too far
Too soon
You saw the whole of the moon

I was grounded
While you filled the skies
I was dumbfounded by truths
You cut through lies
I saw the rain-dirty valley
You saw Brigadoon
I saw the crescent
You saw the whole of the moon

I spoke about wings
You just flew
I wondered, I guessed and I tried
You just knew
I sighed
But you swooned
I saw the crescent
You saw the whole of the moon
The whole of the moon

With a torch in your pocket
And the wind at your heels
You climbed on the ladder
And you know how it feels
To get too high
Too far
Too soon
You saw the whole of the moon
The whole of the moon

Unicorns and cannonballs
Palaces and piers
Trumpets, towers, and tenements
Wide oceans full of tears
Flags, rags, ferry boats
Scimitars and scarves
Every precious dream and vision
Underneath the stars

Yes, you climbed on the ladder
With the wind in your sails
You came like a comet
Blazing your trail
Too high
Too far
Too soon
You saw the whole of the moon"
404,405,Lopen Tot De Zon Komt,Acda & De Munnik,1997,"Kijk naar buiten door het raam
Zie me staan hier in de sneeuw
Ik ben gekomen om te lachen
Om de blunder van de eeuw

Laat je man maar rustig slapen
Dan hebben wij even de tijd
Blijf maar warm bij het raam staan,
Ik wil alleen even wat kwijt
Of eigenlijk wil ik wat weten:
Heb je nu alles wat je wou?
Werd je wakker met een glimlach?
Zegt 'ie vaak: ""Ik hou van jou"" ?
Houdt 'ie je vast als je soms bang bent?
Kent hij je angst en je verdriet?
Alleen maar schudden met je hoofd, lief
Logisch dat je me verliet

Ik ga weg
Ik ga lopen, ik ga lopen tot de zon komt
Ik ga weg,
tot de zon me achterhaalt
Lopen tot de zon komt
Tot 'ie straalt

Blijf maar binnen, het is goed zo
Ik wou je zien als laatste keer
Wat we samen vroeger droomden
Weet de helft van ons niet meer
Ik hoop dat je gelukkig wordt
Ik hoop dat ik me niet vergis
Ik hoop dat ik gelukkig word
Nu ik zie wat ik zo mis

Houdt 'ie je vast soms, als je bang bent?
Kent hij je angst en je verdriet?
Alleen maar schudden met je hoofd, lief
Logisch dat je me verliet

Ik ga lopen tot de zon komt,
Tot de zon me achterhaalt
Lopen tot de zon komt
Tot 'ie straalt..."
405,406,Solsbury Hill,Peter Gabriel,1977,"Climbing up on Solsbury Hill
I could see the city light
Wind was blowing, time stood still
Eagle flew out of the night
He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing, stretching every nerve
I had to listen, had no choice
I did not believe the information
Just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom, boom, boom
""Son,"" he said, ""grab your things
I've come to take you home""

To keep in silence, I resigned
My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut
So I went from day to day
Though my life was in a rut
Till I thought of what I'd say
Which connection I should cut
I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom, boom, boom
""Hey,"" he said, ""Grab your things
I've come to take you home""
Yeah, back home

When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty, she pirouette
When I think that I am free
Watched by empty silhouette
Who close their eyes but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me
Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
My heart going boom, boom, boom
""Hey,"" I said, ""You can keep my things
They've come to take me home"""

Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free

They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue

Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free

They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night
You took your life, as lovers often do
But I could've told you, Vincent
This world was never meant for
One as beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

Now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free

They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will"

Ik ga met je mee
Want ik laat je nu nooit meer gaan

And nobody's home
(Alone)

So nobody ever told us, baby
How it was gonna be
So what'll happen to us, baby
Guess we'll have to wait and see

When I find out all the reasons
Maybe I'll find another way
Find another day
With all the changing seasons of my life
Maybe I'll get it right next time

And now that you've been broken down
Got your head out of the clouds
You're back down on the ground
And you don't talk so loud
And you don't walk so proud
Anymore, and what for?

Well, I jumped into the river
Too many times to make it home
I'm out here on my own
And drifting all alone
If it doesn't show, give it time
To read between the lines

'Cause I see the storm is getting closer
And the waves, they get so high
Seems everything we've ever known's here
Why must it drift away and die

I'll never find any light to replace you
Guess I'll have to make it through this time
Oh, this time
Without you

I knew the storm was getting closer
And all my friends said I was high
But everything we've ever known's here
I never wanted it to die"
416,417,Born In The Usa,Bruce Springsteen,1985,"Born down in a dead man's town
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
End up like a dog that's been beat too much
Till you spend half your life just to cover it up, now

Born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A., now

Got in a little hometown jam
So they put a rifle in my hands
Sent me off to a foreign land
To go and kill the yellow man

Born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.

Come back home to the refinery
Hiring man says, ""Son, if it was up to me...""
Went down to see my V.A. man
He said, ""Son, don't you understand, now?""

Oh yea
Oh no
No, no,no

I had a brother at Khe Sahn
Fighting off the Viet Cong
They're still there, he's all gone
He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms, now

Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
Ten years burning down the road
Nowhere to run, ain't got nowhere to go

Born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A., now
Born in the U.S.A.
I'm a long gone daddy in the U.S.A., now

Born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.
I'm a cool rocking daddy in the U.S.A., now

No, no, no, no, no, no
Oh no, no
Oh no, no

417,418,I Am...I Said,Neil Diamond,1971,"L.A.'s fine
The sun shines most the time
And the feeling is lay back
Palm trees grow and rents are low
But you know keep thinking about
Making my way back

Well I'm New York City born and raised
But nowadays I'm lost between two shores
L.A.'s fine but it ain't home
New York's home but it ain't mine no more

I am...I said
To no one there
And no one heard at all
Not, even the chair
I am...I cried
I am...said I
And I am lost and I can't even say why
Leaving me lonely still

Did you ever read about a frog who dreamed of being a king
And then became one
Well except for the names and a few other changes
If you talk about me
The story's the same one

But I got an emptiness deep inside
And I've tried but it won't let me go
And I'm not a man who likes to swear
But I never cared for the sound of being alone

I am...I said
To no one there
And no one heard at all
Not, even the chair
I am...I cried
I am...said I
And I am lost and I can't even say why

I am...I said
I am...I cried
I am...
I am...I said"
418,419,The A Team,Ed Sheeran,2011,"White lips, pale face, breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end, struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat, tried to swim, stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes, weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
But she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly

An angel will die, covered in white
Closed eye and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

And we're all under the upper hand
Go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight

In a pipe, fly to the motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

To fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
Angels to die"
419,420,Margherita,Marco Borsato,1996,"In de verte spreekt een stem
Die ik herken van onze ruzies
Over kleine misverstanden
Over grote desillusies

En ik hoor de kille klanken
Van jouw ingehouden woede
Maar wat kan ik meer dan janken
Als ik dit niet kon vermoeden

In een waas hoor ik je zeggen
Dat je alles op wilt geven
Dat je alles met je meeneemt
Wat me lief is in dit leven

En ik luister hoe jouw woorden
Langzaam opgaan in de zinnen
Die me treffen als een bliksem
Met vernietigende kracht

Deze kilte maakt me gek
En dit gevoel is angstaanjagend
Maar je woorden malen verder
En mn ogen kijken vragend

Waarom zei je mij niet eerder
Dat je zo van me vervreemd was
WAAROM SPRAK JE OVER LIEFDE
ALS JE NOOIT VAN MIJ GEHOUDEN HEBT

Ik verlies het van de wanhoop
En ik voel m'n tranen branden
En ik zou niets liever willen
Dan m'n hoofd weer in jouw handen

Maar wat tot een uur geleden
Nog zo veilig heeft geleken
Is een hele grote leugen
En een kaartenhuis gebleken

Het is net of iemand anders
In jouw lichaam is gekropen
En ik heb niet eens gemerkt
Dat die naar binnen is geslopen

Om jouw liefde uit te wissen
En mijn wereld te vernielen
Wil er niemand me vertellen
Dat ik alles heb... gedroomd"

From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow
Hammer of the gods will drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde and sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming

On we sweep with the threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow
How soft your fields so green can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords

On we sweep with the threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day despite of all your losing"

All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

It's much too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
Oh, but losing everything is like the sun going down on me

Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John!

I can't find, oh the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me (oh baby no)
Just because you think I mean you harm

But these cuts I have (cuts I have)
They need love (they need love, they need love)

426,427,De Vondeling Van Ameland,Boudewijn De Groot,2004,"Op het strand van Ameland, was hij als zuig'ling aangespoeld
Overboord gegooid, op een reddingsboei gebonden
Hij had zich op de golven als in de baarmoeder gevoeld
En schreeuwde tot hij door een jutter werd gevonden

Ameland sprak schande van de jutter
Een zonderling die leefde van de wind
Die al de raarste dingen had gevonden
Hoe kwam die jutter nu weer aan dat kind?

Als hij er daags op uit ging om te jutten
Moest de vondeling altijd met hem mee
En toen die na een jaar begon te praten
Was zijn eerste woordje. Zee

Op het strand van Ameland, speelde de kleuter jarenlang
De jutter was zijn meester die hem wijze lessen leerde
Hij stond wijdbeens in het zand, was voor de woeste zee niet bang
En schreeuwde net zolang tot de vloed zich keerde

Ameland sprak schande van de kleuter
De vondeling die schreeuwde als de wind
Hoe was het in vredesnaam toch mogelijk
Dat de zee zich terugtrok voor een kind

Wat hij riep, zou niemand kunnen zeggen
Dat was uit de verte moeilijk te verstaan
En toen ze het de jutter vroegen zij die:
Volgens mij roept hij: ik kom eraan

Ik kom eraan, ik kom eraan
Zee, wind , zon, oceaan
Ik kom eraan

Op het strand van Ameland stond hij als knaap in d'avondzon
Hij zei geen woord, begon zich langzaam uit te kleden
De vloed kwam hem tegemoet, hij zag alleen de horizon
Nog eenmaal draadide hij zich om, liep toen de zee in

Ameland sprak schande van de jongen
De naakte, zonderlinge vondeling
Men had zich bovenop het duin verzameld
Omdat men voelde dat er iets gebeuren ging

En toen begon hij plotseling te schreeuwen
Zo hard dat het tot aan de duinen klonk
Nog even zag men hem op het water lopen
Voor hij in de diepte zakte, en verdronk

Ik kom eraan, ik kom eraan
Zee, wind, zon, oceaan
Ik kom eraan

Ik kom eraan, ik kom eraan
Zee, wind, zon, oceaan
Ik kom eraan"

Under a blood red sky
A crowd has gathered in black and white
Arms entwined, the chosen few

Say it's true, it's true
And we can break through
Though torn in two
We can be one

I, I will begin again
I, I will begin again

Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day, you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast

Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go
And you let her go
Well you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Well, baby, they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I need your halo (halo) halo
I need your halo (halo) halo
I need your halo (halo) halo
I needyour halo (halo) halo
Whoa

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again

Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now

You won't get out the county, 'cause you're damned as free

You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they gotta kiss because I don't get sleep, no

Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down

If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before

But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be without a song or a dance, what are we?

So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
Mmm-mmm, she says I began to sing long before I could talk

And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be without a song or a dance, what are we?

So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a change

Where's thank you for the music? The songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be without a song or a dance, what are we?

So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me
So I say thank you for the music

My eyes become large, and the light that you shine can't be seen?

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray,
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah

A light hits the gloom on the gray

There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain

Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?

And you will be reading
The secrets I sold

Daggers and contacts
And bright shiny limos
I've got a watch
That turns into a lifeboat

Glimmering nightgowns
And poisonous cobras
Silencer under the heel of my shoe

The elegance of China
They sent her to lie here on her back
But as she deeply moves me
She'd rather shoot me in my tracks

And while a Middle Asian lady
She really came as no surprise
But I still did destroy her
And I will smash
Halo of flies

I crossed the ocean
Where no one could see
And I put a time-bomb
In your submarine
Goodbye to old friends
The secret's in hand
With phony papers
And kentucky flats
You never will understand"

Enemies becoming friends
When bitterness ends

This is my church
This is where I heal my hurts
It's in the world I've become
Contained in the hum
Between voice and drum
It's in the change
The poetic justice of cause and effect
Respect, love, compassion

Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done

But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Somebody I used to know

And then she asks me, ""Do you feel all right?""
And I say, ""Yes, I feel wonderful tonight""

I feel wonderful
Because I see the love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realise
How much I love you

It's time to go home now
And I've got an achin' head
So I give her the car keys
And she helps me to bed
And then I tell her as I turn out the light
I say, ""My darlin', you were wonderful tonight
Oh, my darlin', you were wonderful tonight"""
455,456,Tribute,Tenacious D,2003,"This is the greatest and best song in the world
Tribute
Long time ago, me and my brother Kyle here
We was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road
All of a sudden
There shined a shiny demon
In the middle of the road
And he said!
""Play the best song in the world, or I'll eat your souls""
Well, me and Kyle
We looked at each other
And we each said
""Okay""

And we played the first thing that came to our heads
Just so happened to be
The best song in the world
It was the best song in the world

Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
One and one make two, two and one make three
It was destiny
Once every hundred-thousand years or so
When the sun doth shine, and the moon doth glow
And the grass doth grow

Needless to say
The beast was stunned
A-whip-crack went his whippy tail!
And the beast was done
He asked us
""Be you angels?""
And we said ""Nay
We are but men""
Rock!
Ah, ah, ah
Ho, whoa, oh-yo!

This is not the greatest song in the world, no
This is just a tribute!
Couldn't remember the greatest song in the world, yeah, no!
This is a tribute, oh
To the greatest song in the world
All right!
It was the greatest song in the world
All right!
It was just the best motherfuckin' song
The greatest song in the world, all right!

Dee soo guh goo gee goo gee
Goo guh fli-goo gee goo, guh fli-goo ga goo buh dee
Ooh guh goo bee, ooh guh guh bee guh guh bee
Fli-goo gee goo, a-fli-guh woo wa mama
Lucifer

And the peculiar thing is this, my friends
The song we sang on that fateful night
It didn't actually sound anything like this song!

This is just a tribute!
You gotta believe me
And I wish you were there
Just a matter of opinion
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
Good God, got lovin'
Just so surprised to find you can't stop it
Oh hallelujah, I'm found
Rich motherfucking ka-chug

All right!
All right!"

You're the book that I have opened
And now I've got to know much more
The curiousness of your potential kiss
Has got my mind and body aching
Really hurt me, baby, really hurt me, baby

Again, I would spend them with you

To do the things you want to do, once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go through time with

On her ship tied to the mast
To distant lands, takes both my hands
Never a frown with golden brown

Golden brown, finer temptress
Through the ages she's heading west
From far away, stays for a day

Thoughts wander all of the time

Live life without you

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride

If being myself is what I do wrong
Then I would rather not be right
Hopes turned into fear and with my
One wing I can't fly

With sunrise, embrace my
Dreams tight and that's why

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
Birds

To a place without fear, with no moonlight
(To a place without moonlight and fear)
All I need are trees and flowers and some sunlight
(All I need is trees, some flowers and sunlight)

Where memories are being made
And where the old one dies
Where love ain't lost

Out of the sky like raindrops

Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
That's why birds don't fly"

May be the chill that autumn brings
May be a hundred different things
Within the measure of a day

She
May be the beauty or the beast
May be the famine or the feast
May turn each day into a heaven or a hell
She may be the mirror of my dreams
A smile reflected in a stream
She may not be what she may seem
Inside her shell

She, who always seems so happy in a crowd
Whose eyes can be so private and so proud
No one's allowed to see them when they cry
She may be the love that cannot hope to last
May come to me from shadows of the past
That I remember till the day I die

She
May be the reason I survive
The why and wherefore I'm alive
The one I'll care for through the rough and rainy years
Me, I'll take her laughter and her tears
And make them all my souvenirs

The meaning of my life is

477,478,Thunder Road,Bruce Springsteen,1975,"The screen door slams, Mary's dress sways
Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy Orbison's singing for the lonely
Hey, that's me and I want you only
Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again

Don't run back inside, darling, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty, but hey, you're alright
Oh, and that's alright with me

You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a savior to rise from these streets

Well now, I'm no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey, what else can we do now?

Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busted open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting down on the tracks

Oh, come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road
Oh, Thunder Road

Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run
Oh, Thunder Road, sit tight
Take hold, Thunder Road

Well, I got this guitar and I've learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
Tonight we'll be free, all the promises will be broken

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet

And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines roaring on
But when you get to the porch they're gone on the wind
So Mary climb in
It's a town full of losers, I'm pulling out of here to win"

And the world can't erase his fantasies

And we will live together
Until the twelfth of never
Our voices will ring forever as one

Every thought is a dream
Rushing by in a stream
Bringing life to the kingdom of doing

Take a ride in the sky
On our ship fantasii
All your dreams will come true miles away

Our voices will ring together
Until the twelfth of never
We all will live love forever as one

Come see victory
In the land called fantasy
Loving life, a new decree
Bring your mind to everlasting liberty

Our minds will explore together
Old worlds, we conquer, forever
We then will expand love together as one

Come to see victory
In a land called fantasy
Loving life for you and me
To behold, to your soul is ecstasy

You will find other kind
That has been in search of you
Many lives has brought you to
Recognize it's your life now in review

And as you stay for the play
Fantasy has in store for you
A glowing light will see you through
It's your day, shining day
All your dreams come true

As you glide, in your stride
With the wind as you fly away
Give a smile, from your lips and say
I am free, yes I'm free, now I'm on my way

Come to see victory
In a land called fantasy
Loving life, for you and me
To behold, to your soul is ecstasy

You will find other kind
That has been in search of you
Many lives has brought you to
Recognize it's your life, now in review"

Slaap maar lekker in je mooie witte huis.
Denk maar niet te veel aan al die verre kusten
waar uw jongens zitten, eenzaam, ver van thuis.
Denk vooral niet aan die zesenveertig doden,
die vergissing laatst met dat bombardement.
En vergeet het vierde van die tien geboden
die u als goed christen zeker kent.

Denk maar niet aan al die jonge frontsoldaten
eenzaam stervend in de verre tropennacht.
Laat die weke pacifistenkliek maar praten,
mijnheer de president, slaap zacht.

Droom maar van de overwinning en de zege,
droom maar van uw mooie vredesideaal
dat nog nooit door bloedig moorden is verkregen,
droom maar dat het u wel lukken zal dit maal.
Denk maar niet aan al die mensen die verrekken,
hoeveel vrouwen, hoeveel kinderen zijn vermoord.
Droom maar dat u aan het langste eind zult trekken
en geloof van al die tegenstand geen woord.

Bajonetten met bloedige gevesten
houden ver van hier op uw bevel de wacht
voor de glorie en de eer van het vrije westen.
Mijnheer de president, slaap zacht.

Schrik maar niet te erg wanneer u in uw dromen
al die schuldeloze slachtoffers ziet staan
die daarginds bij het gevecht zijn omgekomen
en u vragen hoe lang dit nog zo moet gaan.
En u zult toch ook zo langzaamaan wel weten
dat er mensen zijn die ziek zijn van geweld,
die het bloed en de ellende niet vergeten
en voor wie nog steeds een mensenleven telt.

Droom maar niet te veel van al die dode mensen,
droom maar fijn van overwinning en van macht.
Denk maar niet aan al die vredeswensen.

It's ruining everything

I swore, I swore I would be true
And honey so did you
So why were you holding her hand?
Is that the way we stand?
Were you lying all the time?
Was it just a game to you?

But I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You got me wrapped around your finger, uh-huh-huh
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to
Do you have to let it linger?

Oh, I thought the world of you
I thought nothing could go wrong
But I was wrong, I was wrong
If you, if you could get by
Trying not to lie
Things wouldn't be so confused
And I wouldn't feel so used
But you always really knew
I just wanna be with you

And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You got me wrapped around your finger, uh-huh-huh
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to
Do you have to let it linger?

And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You got me wrapped around your finger, uh-huh-huh
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to

And bear my soul

Who can spend the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more

I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother; I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day

Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me

op een vriendelijk woord van mij
als ik jou oproep in gedachte
maakt me dat veel beetjes blij
voel het als ik jou zie zitten
als ik je alleen maar ruik
't zit in honderdduizend vlinders
die zoet zweven in m'n buik

'k heb je lief, m'n hele leven
't is veel meer dan ""houden van""
't is alsof je in m'n bloed zit
ik zonder jou niet leven kan

't zet me zo in vuur en vlam
ik voel het enkel bij jouw aanblik
ik krijg het ook van Rotterdam

wat moet ik zonder jou
't zijn vier hele kleine woordjes
en al maakt je dat een beetje bang
'k heb je lief
vier jaargetijden lang

voel het heel vaak als jij opstaat 
of na een zomerse bui
ik word al week bij de gedachte
jij die loopt in m'n lievelingstrui
't is mijn hand die jij plots vastpakt
als ik domweg naast je fiets
't komt ook, dat is nou het gekke,
zelfs door helemaal niets

'k heb je lief
'k heb je lief
'k heb je lief
wat moet ik zonder jou
't zijn vier hele kleine woordjes
en al maakt je dat een beetje bang
'k heb je lief
14 bloemencorso's lang

ik proef het tijdens ons zoenen
of als je plotseling lacht
ik zie het in vallende sterren
na heftig vrijen in de nacht
't is die tinteling, dat briesje
maakt jou helemaal voor mij
ik denk als ik jou zo zie lopen
God, d'r gaat een engeltje voorbij

'k heb je lief

'k heb je lief
wat moet ik zonder jou

en al maakt je dat een beetje bang

is oud te worden met z'n twee
dat die maar uit mag komen

Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk a smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown up woman should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you dear

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned

And he didn't leave much to Ma and me
Just this ole guitar and an empty bottle of booze

Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me Sue

Well, he musta thought that it was quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from lots a folks
Seems I had to fight my whole life through

Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I'll tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I roamed from town to town to hide my shame

But I made me a vow to the Moon and stars
I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man that give me that awful name

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I'd just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew

At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table dealin' stud
Sat the dirty, mangey dog that named me Sue

Well I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn out picture that my mother had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye

He was big and bent and grey and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold, and I said
""My name is Sue!  How do you do?  Now you gonna die!""
Yeah!  That's what I told him

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down but to my surprise
Came up with a knife an' cut off a piece of my ear

I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kickin' and a-gougin' in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile

Well, I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun but I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said, ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it he's gotta be tough
And I know I wouldn't be there to help you along

So I gave you that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's that name that helped to make you strong""

Yeah!  He said, ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me and ya got the right
To kill me now and I wouldn't blame you if you do

But you oughta thank me before I die
For the gravel in your guts and the spit in the eye
'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue""
Yeah, what could I do?  What could I do?

I got all choked up and threw down my gun
Called him my Pa and he called me his son
And I come away with a different point of view

And I think about him now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George, any-damn-thing but Sue!  I still hate that name!"

""Do you come from a land down under?
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover""

Buying bread from a man in Brussels
He was six foot four and full of muscles
I said, ""Do you speak-a my language?""
He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich
And he said:

""I come from a land down under
Where beer does flow and men chunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover""

Lying in a den in Bombay
With a slack jaw and not much to say
I said to the man, ""Are you trying to tempt me?
Because I come from the land of plenty""
And he said:

""Oh! Do you come from a land down under? (oh yeah yeah)
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover""

517,518,Is She Really Going Out With Him? (Live),Joe Jackson,1988,"Pretty women out walking with gorillas down my street
From my window I'm staring while my coffee goes cold
Look over there (Where?)
There, there's a lady that I used to know
She's married now or engaged or something, so I'm told

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here

Tonight's the night when I go to all the parties down my street
I wash my hair and I kid myself I look real smooth
Look over there (Where?)
There, here comes Jeanie with her new boyfriend
They say that looks don't count for much and so there goes your proof

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here
Around here

But if looks could kill
There's a man there who's marked down as dead
'Cause I've had my fill
Listen, you, take your hands from her head
I get so mean around this scene
Hey, hey, hey

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here

Around here
Something going wrong around here
Something going wrong around here
Something going wrong around here
Something going wrong around"

You were always on my mind

You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine

If I made you feel second best
Girl, I'm sorry I was blind
You were always on my mind

You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance to keep you satisfied, satisfied

All you do is love and love is all you do
I should know by now the way I fought for you
You're not to blame
Everyone's the same

I know you think that you're safe
Mister
Harmless deception that keeps love at bay
It's the ones who resist that we most want to kiss
Wouldn't you say?

Cowboys and angels
They all have the time for you
Why should I imagine
That I'd be a find for you
Why should I imagine
That I'd have something to say

But that scar on your face
That beautiful face of yours
In your heart there's a trace
Of someone before

When your heart's in someone else's plans
Things you say and things you do
They don't understand
It's such a shame
Always ends the same

You can call it love but I don't think it's true
You should know by now
I'm not the boy for you
You're not to blame
Always ends the same

I know you think that you're safe
Sister
Harmless affection that keeps things this way
It's the ones who persist for the sake of a kiss
Who will pay

Cowboys and angels
They all take a shine to you
Why should I imagine
That I was designed for you
Why should I believe
That you would stay

But that scar on your face
That beautiful face of yours
Don't you think that I know
They hurt you before

Take this man to your bed
Maybe his hands
Will help you forget
Please be stronger than your past
The future may still give you a chance"

Keine Brust hat Milch geweint
In meiner Kehle steckt ein Schlauch
Hab keinen Nabel auf dem Bauch

Mutter

Ich durfte keine Nippel lecken
Und keine Falte zum Verstecken
Niemand gab mir einen Namen
Gezeugt in Hast und ohne Samen

Der Mutter die mich nie geboren
Hab ich heute Nacht geschworen
Ich werd ihr eine Krankheit schenken
Und sie danach im Fluss versenken

Mutter

In ihren Lungen wohnt ein Aal
Auf meiner Stirn ein Muttermal
Entferne es mit Messers Kuss
Auch wenn ich daran sterben muss

Auf meiner Stirn ein Muttermal
Entferne es mit Messers Kuss

Saying, ""How do you do?""
They're really saying, ""I love you""

Als het huilen langs huizen klinkt 
Als de wind je voorover dwingt 
Hier ben ik! 

Ren Lenny ren 
Als je me mist ren even heel hard met me mee 
Ren Lenny ren 
En ben je boos, heb je geen zin 
Ren toch, maar hard tegen me in 
Ren Lenny ren 

Zoek me in de bomen 
Zie de toppen zwaaiend gaan 
Ik ben je vader de wind, ik kom er aan! 
Zoek me in de havens 
En als de boten langzaam dansen gaan 
Je vader de wind komt er aan! 

Als het graan op de velden wuift 
Als het zand over duinen stuift 
Als de wind zelfs je fiets verschuift 
Hier ben ik! 

Als het haar voor je ogen waait 
Als je jas om je lichaam draait 
Als de wind langs je wangen aait 
Weet dat ik je mis! 

Ren Lenny ren 
Als je me mist ren even heel hard met me mee 
Ren Lenny ren 
En ben je boos, heb je geen zin 
Ren toch, maar hard tegen me in 
Ren Lenny ren"
539,540,Who'll Stop The Rain,Creedence Clearwater Revival,1970,"Long as I remember
The rain been coming down
Clouds of mystery pouring
Confusion on the ground
Good men through the ages
Trying to find the sun
And I wonder
Still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain?

I went down Virginia
Seeking shelter from the storm
Caught up in the fable
I watched the tower grow
Five year plans and new deals
Wrapped in golden chains
And I wonder
Still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain?

Heard the singers playing
How we cheered for more
Crowd had rushed together
Trying to keep warm
Still the rain kept pouring
Falling on my ears
And I wonder
Still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain?"
540,541,One Step Beyond,Madness,1979,"Hey you, don't watch that
Watch this!
This is the heavy heavy monster sound
The nuttiest sound around
So if you've come in off the street
And you're beginning to feel the heat
Well listen buster
You better start to move your feet
To the rockinest, rock-steady beat
Of madness
One step beyond!"
541,542,American Pie,Don McLean,1972,"A long, long time ago
I can still remember how that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

So bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Did you write the book of love?
And do you have faith in God above?
If the Bible tells you so
Now, do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage bronkin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died

I started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Now for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lenin read a book on Marx
A quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

We were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry 
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the halftime air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

We started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

He was singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died

And they were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

They were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' ""This'll be the day that I die"""

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought? It figures

Mr. Play-It-Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down, he thought, ""Well, isn't this nice?""

It's like rain on your wedding day

Well, life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
When you think everything's okay and everything's going right
And life has a funny way of helping you out
When you think everything's gone wrong
And everything blows up in your face

A traffic jam when you're already late
A ""No Smoking"" sign on your cigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting his beautiful wife, hmph
And isn't it ironic? Don't you think?
A little too ironic, and yeah I really do think

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought? It figures

And yeah, oh, life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
Life has a funny, funny way of helping you out
Helping you out"
543,544,Rood,Marco Borsato,2006,"Rood is al lang het rood niet meer
Het rood van rode rozen
De kleur van liefde van weleer
Lijkt door de haat gekozen

Dat mooie rood was ooit voor mij
Een kleur van passie en van wijn
Ik wil haar terug, die mooie tijd
Maar zij lijkt lang vervlogen

En alle beelden op tv
Van bloed en oorlog om ons heen
Werken daar ook niet echt aan mee

Dus ik neem heel bewust het besluit
De krant leg ik weg
En de tv gaat uit

Vandaag is rood de kleur van jouw lippen
Vandaag is rood wat rood hoort te zijn
Vandaag is rood
Het rood van rood wit blauw
Van heel mijn hart voor jou
Schreeuw van de roodbedekte daken dat ik van je hou Vandaag is rood gewoon weer liefde tussen jou en mij

Ik loop de deur door en naar buiten waar de zon begint te schijnen
Laat alles achter, kijk vooruit en met mijn laatste rooie cent
Koop ik een veel te grote bos met honderdvijftig rode rozen
Een voor elk jaar waarvan ik hoop dat jij nog bij me bent

Vandaag is rood de kleur van jouw lippen
Vandaag is rood wat rood hoort te zijn
Vandaag is rood
Het rood van rood wit blauw
Van heel mijn hart voor jou
Schreeuw van de roodbedekte daken dat ik van je hou Vandaag is rood gewoon weer liefde tussen jou en mij

En nu sta je hier zo voor me
De rode avondzon streelt jouw gezicht
Je bent een wonder voor me
Denk ik, terwijl een doorn mijn vinger prikt

Rood is mijn bloed dat valt op de grond
En even lijk ik verloren
Maar jij brengt mijn vingers naar je mond

En je kust ze
En ik weet

Vandaag is rood de kleur van jouw lippen
Vandaag is rood wat rood hoort te zijn
Vandaag is rood
Het rood van rood wit blauw
Van heel mijn hart voor jou
Schreeuw van de roodbedekte daken dat ik van je hou Vandaag is rood gewoon weer liefde tussen jou en mij  

Vandaag... is rood

Gooi de loper uit
En drink een goed glas wijn
Pluk de dag want het kan zo ineens de laatste zijn
Vandaag is rood gewoon weer liefde tussen jou en mij

Vandaag staat rood weer voor de liefde
tussen jou en mij"

I run away like mercury

When you're trying to patch us up
And I say 'honey what is love?'

Maybe I'm defective
Maybe I'm dumb

For what I've done

Maybe I'm bad natured
Or maybe I'm young

For what I've done

And then the T-shirt that I wear
And pick the thorns out of my hair
I broke your heart so carelessly
But made the pieces part of me

Because you taught me how to love
It's me who taught you how to stop

I'm not broke, I'm just a brokenhearted man
I know it makes no sense, what else can I do?
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?

So I'm not moving
I'm not moving

Oh whoa
There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world

And maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved

549,550,High Hopes,Pink Floyd,1994,"Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun

Along the long road and on down the causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut

There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide

At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river

Forever and ever

spoken:
""Hello?""
""Yes?""
""Is that Charlie?""
""Yes""
""Hello Charlie""
""Great"""
550,551,Changes,2Pac,1998,"Come on, come on
I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
I'm tired of being poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm looking for a purse to snatch

Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
One less hungry mouth on the welfare

First ship them dope and let them deal the brothers
Give them guns, step back, watch them kill each other
It's time to fight back, that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead

I got love for my brother but we can never go nowhere
Unless we share with each other
We gotta start making changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers

And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change, and that's the way it is

That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Oh, yeah

I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted

Take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right
'Cause both black and white is smoking crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other

And although it seems heaven sent
We ain't ready, to see a black President
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks

But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you staying in the dope game
Now tell me what's a mother to do
Being real don't appeal to the brother in you

You gotta operate the easy way
I made a G today, But you made it in a sleazy way
Selling crack to the kids, I gotta get paid,
Well hey, that's the way it is

That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Oh, yeah


And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace
It's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty they got a war on drugs
So the police can bother me

And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts giving it back to you
Don't let them jack you up, back you up,
Crack you up and pimp smack you up

You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this when they try to rush I bust this

That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool
My mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back

'Cause I always got to worry about the paybacks
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Coming back after all these years
Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat
That's the way it is, uh

That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Oh, yeah

You're my brother, you're my sister

I watched you suffer a dull aching pain
Now you decided to show me the same
No sweeping exits or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away

I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie
I have my freedom, but I don't have much time
Faith has been broken, tears must be cried

Will you release me with a kiss?

If I have - how could I fail?
Did I fear the consequence?

Now you shaped that liquid wax
Fit it out with crater cracks
Sweet devotion, my delight.

Oh, you're such a pretty one,
And the naked thrills of flesh and skin
Would tease me through the night.

Now I hate to leave you bare.
If you need me I'll be there,
Don't you ever let me down.

Dazed by careless words,
Cosy in my mind.

I don't mind,

I don't mind,

Calls for the stuff he'd rather blame.

Tot de nacht zal komen 
heerlijk dromen dat jij hier bent
En ik jou kan voelen
Naar jou kan lachen, voelt het soms alsof ik zonder
Veel te leeg en veel te kil ben
En niet echt meer adem

Ik ga vandaag een berg beklimmen
En de top bereiken 
Met jou in mijn hart
Waar ik jou wil houden
Vast wil houden, ik ben bang dat ik straks zonder
Veel te klein en veel te kil ben
En me niet kan vinden

Ik zal vandaag de storm bedwingen
En haar laten razen 
tot ze stil is met jou bij mij
Kan ik alles
Wil ik alles, en ik weet dat ik straks zonder
Veel te klein en niks meer waard ben
En geen dag meer door kan

Dat komt door jou
Dat komt gewoon door jou
Jouw hart zit heel dicht bij mij
Jouw hart zit heel diep in mij

Ik wil vandaag de lucht versieren
En haar kleuren geven 
die net zo mooi zijn zoals jij
En ik roep de regen 
en de zonnestralen, en ik fluister dat ik zonder
Heel alleen een heel klein mens ben
En geen weg kan vinden

Ik zal vandaag een liedje schrijven
En ze woorden geven
die voor jou alleen voor jou zijn
Zing je zacht met me mee
Onze woorden, en ik weet dat ik straks zonder
Veel te bang en veel te min ben
En niet door wil zingen

Ik ga vandaag van alles kunnen
Tot de dag voorbij is 
en ik weet dat ik maar 1 ding wil
Dat je mee gaat met mij
Bij me blijven, want ik weet dat ik straks zonder
Niets meer wil en niets meer kan
Dan alleen maar huilen

Dat komt door jou
Dat komt gewoon door jou
Jouw hart zit heel dicht bij mij
Jouw hart zit heel diep in mij

Dat komt door jou
Jouw oogverblindend zijn
Jouw hart zit heel dicht bij mij
Jouw hart zit heel diep in mij

Als ik vandaag de dag met jou mag
Zo een die zacht voorbij gaat 
terwijl de wereld weg lijkt
En dat ik naar je kijk
Naar jou blijf lachen, voelt het soms alsof het wonder
Veel te mooi en veel te groot is
En nooit bestaan heeft

Als ik vannacht de nacht met jou mag
Zo een die zacht voorbij glijdt 
alsof de wereld weg lijkt
En ik naar je kijk
Naar jou blijf lachen, voelt het weer alsof het wonder
Veel te mooi en veel te groot is
En nooit terugkeert

Als ik de dag en nacht met jou mag
En die twee voorbij gaan 
terwijl heel de wereld wegkijkt
Dan hou ik je vast
En we zweven, voelt het nog alsof het wonder
Veel te mooi en veel te groot is
Te mooi voor mij is

Dat komt door jou
Dat komt gewoon door jou
Jouw hart zit heel dicht bij mij
Jouw hart zit heel diep in mij

Dat komt door jou
Jouw oogverblindend zijn
Jouw hart zit heel dicht bij mij
Jouw hart zit heel diep in mij

558,559,Groot Hart,De Dijk,1985,"dokter kunt u even komen
breng uw beste medicijn
ik heb er nu al jaren last van
ook al doet het niet echt pijn
maar ik val voor alle vrouwen
alle vrouwen op het bal
dat is te veel om van te houden
dokter ik heb een spoedgeval

ik heb een groot hart
dit hart zo groot
het wordt nog mijn dood
ik heb een groot hart

neem een ochtend als vanochtend
vroeg op en de zon die scheen
opgeruimd loop ik naar buiten
zie een meisje ik denk alleen
ik dacht dat ze naar me lachte
dus vrolijk lach ik naar haar terug
maar die boom was haar vriend
dokter komt u vlug

ik heb een groot hart
dit hart zo groot
het wordt nog mijn dood
ik heb een groot hart

dokter straks is het weer lente
als u begrijpt wat ik bedoel
al dat moois langs 's heren wegen
en dan krijg ik dat gevoel
loop driemaal daags onder een auto
ik stoot dagelijks vijf keer mijn kop
dat is teveel om van te houden
dokter weet u daar iets op

ik heb een groot hart
dit hart zo groot
het wordt nog mijn dood
ik heb een groot hart"
559,560,Gimme Gimme Gimme,ABBA,1979,"Half past twelve
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own!
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see; no one in sight
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

561,562,Toen Ik Je Zag,Hero,1997,"Ik dacht nooit aan morgen, vandaag was lang genoeg
Totdat ik jou zag, en ik dacht ineens aan morgenvroeg
Ik hield niet van de liefde, voor mij was er geen vrouw
Totdat ik jou zag, en ik hield zomaar ineens van jou

Je hebt niet in de gaten, wat je allemaal met me doet
En dat kun je ook niet weten, ik heb je pas 1 keer ontmoet
En toen heb je mij misschien, niet eens gezien

Ik ging nooit naar buiten, echt vrolijk was ik niet
Nu loop ik zelfs te fluiten, en ik kijk of ik jou ergens zie
Ik kon om niemand lachen, ik was tot niets in staat
Nu ben ik dag en nacht een zon, omdat ik weet dat jij bestaat

Je hebt niet in de gaten, wat je allemaal met me doet
En dat kun je ook niet weten, ik heb je pas 1 keer ontmoet
En toen heb je mij misschien, niet eens gezien

Als ik jou zou vragen, drink jij wat van mij
Zou je dan lachen, blijft het daarbij
Ik moet het toch proberen, ik weet alleen niet hoe
Niet langer verlegen, ik wil ik zal ik ga naar je toe

Er was een donder een bliksem, een slag toen ik je zag
Ik ben veranderd een ander, sinds die ene lach
Ik geef me over je hebt me, verzetten heeft geen zin
Ik ben veranderd een ander, en dit is pas het begin

Want je hebt niet in de gaten wat je allemaal met me doet
En dat kun je ook niet weten, ik heb je pas 1 keer ontmoet
En toen heb je mij misschien, ja heel misschien, niet eens, gezien"

Fills the spaces up in your dreams
That reminds me

(Everything now)
(Everything now)

Every inch of road's got a sign
And every boy uses the same line
I pledge allegiance to everything now
Every song that I've ever heard
Is playing at the same time, it's absurd
It reminds me, we've got everything now
We turn the speakers up till they break
'Cause every time you smile it's a fake!
Stop pretending, you've got...

Leave your car in the middle of the road

Ashes of everything now
And then you're black again
Can't make it back again
From everything now"

I can't say anymore than ""I love you""
Everything else is a waste of breath

I want you
You've had your fun you don't get well no more
I want you
Your fingernails go dragging down the wall
Be careful darling you might fall

I want you
I woke up and one of us was crying
I want you
You said ""Young man I do believe you're dying""
I want you
If you need a second opinion as you seem to do these days
I want you
You can look in my eyes and you can count the ways

I want you
Did you mean to tell me but seem to forget
I want you
Since when were you so generous and inarticulate
I want you
It's the stupid details that my heart is breaking for
It's the way your shoulders shake and what they're shaking for
I want you
It's knowing that he knows you now after only guessing
It's the thought of him undressing you or you undressing

I want you
He tossed some tatty compliment your way
I want you
And you were fool enough to love it when he said
""I want you""

I want you
The truth can't hurt you it's just like the dark
It scares you witless
But in time you see things clear and stark
I want you
Go on and hurt me then we'll let it drop
I want you
I'm afraid I won't know where to stop
I want you
I'm not ashamed to say I cried for you
I want you
I want to know the things you did that we do too
I want you
I want to hear he pleases you more than I do
I want you
I might as well be useless for all it means to you
I want you
Did you call his name out as he held you down
I want you
Oh no my darling not with that clown
I want you

I want you
You've had your fun you don't get well no more
I want you
No-one who wants you could want you more
I want you
I want you

I want you
Every night when I go off to bed and when I wake up
I want you

I'm going to say it once again 'til I instill it
I know I'm going to feel this way until you kill it
I want you
I want you
I want you"
564,565,Sometimes It Snows In April,Prince & The Revolution,1986,"Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war
Just after I'd wiped away his last tear
I guess he's better off than he was before
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here

I used to cry for Tracy 'cause he was my only friend
Those kind of cars don't pass you everyday
I used to cry for Tracy 'cause I wantto see him again
But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending
And all good things, they say, never last

Springtime was always my favorite time of year
A time for lovers holding hands in the rain
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears
Always cry for love, never cry for pain

He used to say so strong unafraid to die
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized
No, staring at his picture I realized
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending
And all good things, they say, never last

I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there
I know that he has found another friend
Maybe he's found the answer to all the April snow
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending
But all good things, they say, never last

All good things they say, never last
And love, it isn't love until it's past"

So somebody ran out
Left somebody's heart in a mess
Well, if you're looking for love
Honey, I'm tougher than the rest

Some girls they want a handsome Dan
Or some good-lookin' Joe
On their arms some girls
Like a sweet-talkin' Romeo

Well, 'round here, baby
I learned you get what you can get
So if you're rough enough for love
Honey, I'm tougher than the rest

Yeah, the road is dark
And it's a thin, thin line
But I want you to know
I'll walk it for you any time

Maybe your other boyfriends
Couldn't pass the test
Well, if you're rough and ready for love
Honey, I'm tougher than the rest

Well, it ain't no secret
I've been around a time or two
Well, I don't know, baby
Maybe you've been around too

Well, there's another dance
All you gotta do is say yes

567,568,Hard Sun,Eddie Vedder,2007,"When I walk beside her, I am a better man
When I look to leave her, I always stagger back again
Once I built an ivory tower so I could worship from above
When I climbed down to be set free, she took me in again

There's a big, a big hard sun
Beating on the big people
In the big hard world

When she comes to greet me, she is mercy at my feet
Yeah, when I see her inner charms, she just throws it back at me
Once I dug an early grave to find a better land
She just smiled and laughed at me and took her blues back again

There's a big, a big hard sun
Beating on the big people
In the big hard world

There's a big, a big hard sun
Beating on the big people
In the big hard world

When I go to cross that river, she is comfort by my side
When I try to understand, she just opens up her hands

There's a big, a big hard sun
Beating on the big people
In the big hard world

Once I stood to lose her when I saw what I had done
Bound down and threw away the hours of her garden and her sun
So I tried to warn her, I turned to see her weep
Forty days and forty nights and it's still coming down on me

There's a big, a big hard sun
Beating on the big people
In the big hard world

There's a big, a big hard sun
Beating on the big people
In the big hard world

There's a big, a big hard sun

570,571,Leningrad,Billy Joel,1989,"Viktor was born in the spring of '44
And never saw his father anymore
A child of sacrifice, a child of war
Another son who never had
A father after Leningrad

Went off to school and learned to serve the state
Followed the rules and drank his vodka straight
The only way to live was drown the hate
A Russian life was very sad
And such was life in Leningrad

I was born in '49
A cold war kid in McCarthy time
Stop 'em at the 38th Parallel
Blast those yellow reds to hell

And cold war kids were hard to kill
Under their desk in an air raid drill
Haven't they heard we won the war
What do they keep on fighting for?

Viktor was sent to some Red Army town
Served out his time, became a circus clown
The greatest happiness he'd ever found
Was making Russian children glad
And children lived in Leningrad

But children lived in Levittown
And hid in the shelters underground
Until the Soviets turned their ships around
And tore the Cuban missiles down

And in that bright October sun
We knew our childhood days were done
And I watched my friends go off to war
What do they keep on fighting for?

And so my child and I came to this place
To meet him eye to eye and face to face
He made my daughter laugh, then we embraced
We never knew what friends we had
Until we came to Leningrad"

In '65, tension was running high at my high school

Words were passed, in a shotgun blast troubled times had come

In my hometown
My hometown

Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores
Seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more
They're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks

But if I did I would summon them together

To each burn a candle for you
To make bright and clear your path
And to walk like Christ, in grace and love
And guide you into my arms

Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms

And I know that you do too
And I believe in some kind of path
That we can walk down, me and you

And make your journey bright and pure
That you'll keep returning

Non je ne regrette rien
Ni le bien, qu'on m'a fait
Ni le mal, tout ça m'est bien égale

Non, rien de rien
Non, je ne regrette rien

Je me fous du passé

Avec mes souvenirs
J'ai allumé le feu
Mes chagrins, mes plaisirs
Je n'ai plus besoin d'eux

Balayées les amours
Avec leurs trémolos
Balayés pour toujours
Je repars à zéro

Non, je ne regrette rien

I thought it up and brought up the past

Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I married the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind

Separate my side, I don't

The ashtray's full and I'm spilling my guts

A scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for a soulmate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread
I gotta take it on the other side

Take it on the other side
Take it on, take it on

How long, how long will I slide
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad

Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
Burn me out, leave me on the other side

Remember how you made me crazy, remember how I made you scream
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe, I'm gonna get you back, I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

I can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sun
I see you walkin' real slow, and smilin' at everyone
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

Out on the road today, I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said, ""don't look back, you can never look back""
I thought I knew what love was, what did I know?
Those days are gone forever, I should just let them go, but

I can see you, your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got the top pulled down and the radio on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

Kissing in the blue dark
Playing pool and wild darts

The photograph on the dashboard taken years ago
Turned around backwards so the windshield shows
Every street light reveals a picture in reverse
Still it's so much clearer
I forgot my shirt at the water's edge
The moon is low tonight

Nightswimming deserves a quiet night
I'm not sure all these people understand
It's not like years ago
The fear of getting caught
The recklessness in water
They cannot see me naked
These things they go away
Replaced by every day

Nightswimming
Remembering that night
September's coming soon
I'm pining for the moon
And what if there were two
Side by side in orbit around the fairest sun?
The bright tide forever drawn
Could not describe nightswimming

You, I thought I knew you
You, I cannot judge
You, I thought you knew me
This one laughing quietly
Underneath my breath
Nightswimming

The photograph reflects
Every street light a reminder

Deserves a quiet night

Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
Don't ya?

You've torn your dress
Your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of 'ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?

So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chile, chi-chile
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you?
Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh how could they know?
Eh, eh"

I remember when, sittin' in the tub
Pulled out the plug, the water was runnin' out
Cool down, stop actin' crazy
They're gonna leave, and we'll be on our own
Seven times five
They were living creatures
Watch them come to life, right before your eyes
Back slidin' how do you do?
These slippery people, gonna see you through

597,598,Like A Rollin' Stone,Bob Dylan,1965,"Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime
Didn't you?
People'd call, say: ""Beware, doll, you're bound to fall""
You thought they were all
Kiddin' you

You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hanging out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging
For your next meal

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Oh, you've gone to the finest school, alright, miss lonely
But you know you only used to get
Juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna have to get
Used to it

You say you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say: ""Do you want to
Make a deal?""

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did
Tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your
Kicks for you

You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything
He could steal?

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To hang on your home
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinking thinking that they
Got it made
Exchanging all their precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring
You'd better pawn it, baby

You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets
To conceal

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?"

599,600,Year Of The Cat,Al Stewart,1977,"On a morning from a Bogart movie
In a country where they turn back time
You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre
Contemplating a crime
She comes out of the sun in a silk dress
Running like a watercolor in the rain
Don't bother asking for explanations
She'll just tell you that she came
In the year of the cat

She doesn't give you time for questions
As she locks up your arm in hers
And you follow till your sense of which direction
Completely disappears
By the blue-tiled walls near the market stalls
There's a hidden door she leads you to
These days, she says, I feel my life
Just like a river running through
The year of the cat

She looks at you so cooly
And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea
She comes in incense and patchouli
So you take her to find what's waiting inside
The year of the cat

Morning comes and you're still with her
And the bus and the tourists are gone
And you've thrown away your choice and lost your ticket
So you have to stay on
But the drumbeat strains of the night remain
In the rhythm of the newborn day
You know sometime you're bound to leave her
But for now you're gonna stay
In the year of the cat"

602,603,Heal The World,Michael Jackson,1992,"Think about the generations and say we wanna make it a better place
For our children and our children's children
So that they know what's a better world for them
And think they can make it a better place

There's a place in your heart and I know that it is love
And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try, you'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow
There are ways to get there if you care enough for the living
Make a little space, make a better place

Heal the world, make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying if you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

If you want to know why, there's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see, in this bliss we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living
Then it feels that always love's enough for us growing
Make a better world, make a better world

Heal the world, make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying if you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life, wound this Earth, crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see, this world is heavenly, be God's glow

We could fly so high, let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear, together we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares
We could really get there if you cared enough for the living
Make a little space to make a better place

Heal the world, make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying if you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

Heal the world, make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying if you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

Heal the world, make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying if you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

There are people dying
If you care enough for the living

And the men are all the same
You don't look at their faces

Keeping your eyes on the wall

I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money
I'll do what you want me to do
I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money
And any ol' music will do

I wanna make a million dollars
I wanna live out by the sea
Have a husband and some children
Yeah, I guess I want a family

Deutschmarks or Dollars?
American Express will do nicely, thank you
Let me loosen up your collar
Tell me, do you wanna see me do the shimmy again?

I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money
Do what you want me to do
I'm your private dancer, dancer for money

615,616,Hey You,Pink Floyd,1979,"Hey you, out there in the cold
Getting lonely, getting old
Can you feel me?
Hey you, standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me?
Hey you, don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight

Hey you, out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?
Hey you, with your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me?
Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home

But it was only fantasy
The wall was too high
As you can see
No matter how he tried
He could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain

Hey you, out there on the road
Always doing what you're told
Can you help me?
Hey you, out there beyond the wall
Breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me?
Hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall

618,619,Slow Dancing In A Burning Room,John Mayer,2006,"It's not a silly little moment
It's not the storm before the calm
This is the deep and dying breath
Of this love that we've been working on

Can't seem to hold you like I want to
So I can feel you in my arms
Nobody's gonna come and save you
We pulled too many false alarms

We're going down
And you can see it, too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room

I was the one you always dreamed of
You were the one I tried to draw
How dare you say it's nothing to me?
Baby, you're the only light I ever saw
I'll make the most of all the sadness
You'll be a bitch because you can
You'll try to hit me just hurt me
So you leave me feeling dirty
Cause you can't understand

We're going down
And you can see it, too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room

Go cry about it, why don't you?
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room

Don't you think we oughta know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?"

620,621,Yesterday When I Was Young,Charles Aznavour,1970,"Yesterday when I was young
The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame

The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned
I always built, alas, on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
And only now I see how the years ran away

Yesterday, when I was young
So many drinking songs were waiting to be sung
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see

I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall
Concerned itself with me, me and nothing else at all

Yesterday the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond

The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play

There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
The time has come for me to pay for yesterday
When I was young

Young
Young"

To believe in you

Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies
Oh, no, no, you can't disguise
Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies

Although I'm not making plans
I hope that you understand there's a reason why
Close your, close your, close your eyes
No more broken hearts
We're better off apart
Let's give it a try
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies

Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies

We got many moons that are deep at play
So I keep an eye on the shadow smile
To see what it has to say

You and I both know
Everything must go away
What do you say?

Spinning knot that is on my heart
Is like a bit of light in a touch of dark
You got sneak attack from the zodiac
But I see your fire spark

Eat the breeze and go
Blow by blow and go away
What do you say? Yeah

You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm
Falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Stumble down to the parking lot
You got no time for the afterthought
They're like ice cream for an astronaut
Well that's me looking for we

Turn the corner and
Find the world at your command
Playing the hand

You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm
Falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Do you want this love of mine?
Darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?
Do you want it all the time?
But darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?

Pick you up like a paperback
With the track record of a maniac
So I move it in and we unpack
It's the same as yesterday

Any way we roll
Everything must go away
What do you say? Yeah

You don't know my kind

Tell the world that I'm

iedere nacht
stel dat ik er wel

dan was morgen
morgen waarschijnlijk weer zo'n dag

o ik kan het niet
ik kan het niet
ik kan het niet
ik kan het niet alleen

natte ramen
kale muren
lege flessen
lege flessen op de gang
lange tanden
laten uren
weinig zon
weinig zon en veel behang

en ik kan hiet niet
ik kan er niet omheen
ik kan het niet
ik kan het niet alleen

ik heb het geprobeerd
gedaan wat ik kan
maar alles gaat verkeerd
ik ben ook maar een man
en ik kan het niet alleen

625,626,Father Figure,George Michael,1988,"That's all I wanted
Something special, someone sacred
In your eyes

For just one moment
To be bold and naked
At your side

Sometimes I think that you'll never
Understand me (understand me)
Maybe this time is forever
Say it can be, whoa

That's all you wanted
Something special, someone sacred
In your life

Just for one moment
To be warm and naked
At my side

Sometimes I think that you'll never
Understand me (understand me)
But something tells me together
We'd be happy, whoa baby

I will be your father figure (oh baby)
Put your tiny hand in mine (I'd love to)
I will be your preacher teacher (be your daddy)
Anything you have in mind (it would make me)

I will be your father figure (very happy)
I have had enough of crime (please let me)
I will be the one who loves you
Till the end of time

That's all I wanted
But sometimes love can be mistaken
For a crime

That's all I wanted
Just to see my baby's
Blue-eyed shine

This time I think that my lover
Understands me (understands me)
If we have faith in each other
Then we can be strong, baby

I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine (my baby)
I will be your preacher teacher
Anything you have in mind

I will be your father figure
I have had enough of crime
I will be the one who loves you
Till the end of time

If you are the desert, I'll be the sea
If you ever hunger, hunger for me
Whatever you ask for, that's what I'll be

So when you remember the ones who have lied
Who said that they cared
But then laughed as you cried

Beautiful darling
Don't think of me
Because all I ever wanted
It's in your eyes
Baby, baby
And love can't lie, no

(Greet me with the eyes of a child)
My love is always telling me so
(Heaven is a kiss and a smile)
Just hold on, hold on
And won't let you go, my baby

I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine
I will be your preacher teacher
Anything you have in mind

I will be your father figure
And I have had enough of crime
So I am gonna love you
Till the end of time

(I will be your father) I will be your
(I will be your preacher) Father
(I will be your father) I'll be your daddy, whoa
I will be the one who loves you
Till the end of time"

But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up

It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see, I've always been a fighter
But without you, I give up

I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me

And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers, try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man

When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I wish I was him
With these words of mine
To say to you 'til the end of time

That I will love you baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always

If you told me to cry for you, I could
If you told me to die for you, I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you

Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines

And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

Always, always"
627,628,You're So Vain,Carly Simon,1973,"You walked into the party
Like you were walking onto a yacht
Your hat strategically dipped below one eye
Your scarf it was apricot
You had one eye in the mirror as
You watched yourself gavotte
And all the girls dreamed that they'd be your partner
They'd be your partner, and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain (you're so vain)
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you, don't you?

Oh, you had me several years ago
When I was still quite naive
When you said that we made such a pretty pair
And that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee
Clouds my coffee, and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain (you're so vain)
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you, don't you, don't you?

I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee
clouds in my coffee, and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain (you're so vain)
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you, don't you?

Well, I hear you went up to Saratoga
And your horse naturally won
Then you flew your lear jet up to Nova Scotia
To see the total eclipse of the sun
Well, you're where you should be all the time
And when you're not you're with
Some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend
Wife of a close friend, and

You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain (you're so vain)
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you, don't you, don't you now?

The rubble or our sins?

The rubble or our sins?

(Oh, where do we begin) And the walls kept tumbling down
In the city that we love (The rubble or our sins?)
(Oh, where do we begin) Grey clouds roll over the hills
Bringing darkness from above (The rubble or our sins?)

But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
Oh, how am I gonna be an optimist about this?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
If you close your eyes

I'm standing here outside your door

But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn
The taxi's waiting, he's blowin' his horn
Already I'm so lonesome I could die

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

There's so many times I let you down
So many times I've played around 
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
Every place I go, I'll think of you
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you
When I come back, I'll bring your wedding ring

Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go

Now the time has come to leave you
One more time, let me kiss you
Close your eyes, I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times I won't have to say

Oh, kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go

Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say, ""What did you do with him today?""
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray
'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear men down like Roger Moore

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Upstairs in bed with my ex boy
He's in a place but I can't get joy
Thinking on you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes
Run out to meet you, chips and pita
You say ""When we're married"" cause you're not bitter
""There'll be none of him no more""
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet
Then you notice likkle carpet burn
My stomach drops and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst
Who truly stuck the knife in first

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Some you say you love
Those you call a friend

Walking through a crowd
Then you look around
See there's no one left

We live and then we die as one
We all live under the same sun

Over and over and over and over again and again
'Cause I don't wanna be like them

Over and over and over and over again
And again and again and again

I left my heart in Amsterdam
Where I could dream and nights were long

Over, over, over
Again and again and then over

Moved from side to side

Black and blue
And who knows which is which and who is who
Up and down

The poster bearer cried

There's room for you inside

Sunlit from Heaven
Like the first dew fall
On the first grass

Praise for the sweetness
Of the wet garden
Sprung in completeness
Where His feet pass

Mine is the sunlight
Mine is the morning
Born of the One Light
Eden saw play

Praise with elation
Praise every morning
God's recreation
Of the new day

Dan moet het echt wel liefde zijn
Ondanks de vele kille uren
De domme fouten en de pijn
Heel deze kamer om ons heen
Waar ons bed steeds heeft gestaan
Draagt sporen van een fel verleden
Die wilde hartstocht lijkt nu heen
Die zoete razernij vergaan
De wapens waar we toen mee streden

Ik hou van jou
Met heel mijn hart en ziel
Hou ik van jou
Langs zon en maan
Tot aan het ochtendblauw
Ik hou nog steeds van jou

Jij kent nu al mijn slimme streken
Ik ken allang jouw heksenspel
Ik hoef niet meer om jou te smeken
Jij kent mijn zwakke plaatsen wel
Soms liet ik jou te lang alleen
Misschien was wat je deed verkeerd
Maar ik had ook wel eens vriendinnen
We waren jong en niet van steen
En zo hebben we dan toch geleerd
Je kunt altijd opnieuw beginnen

Ik hou van jou
Met heel mijn hart en ziel
Hou ik van jou
Langs zon en maan
Tot aan het ochtendblauw
Ik hou nog steeds van jou

We hebben zoveel jaar gestreden
Tegen elkaar en met elkaar
Maar rustig leven en tevreden
Is voor de liefde een gevaar
Jij huilt allang niet meer zo snel
Ik laat me niet zo vlug meer gaan
We houden onze woorden binnen
Maar al beheersen we het spel
Een ding blijft toch altijd bestaan
De zoete oorlog van het minnen

Ik hou van jou
Met heel mijn hart en ziel
Hou ik van jou
Langs zon en maan
Tot aan het ochtendblauw
Ik hou nog steeds van jou"

But, really, this can't wait
I wanted to explain
Before it gets too late

For your mother and me
Love has finally died
This is no happy home
But God knows how I've tried

Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy

I know it's hard to understand
Why did we ever start?
We're more like strangers now
Each acting out a part

I have laughed, I have cried
I have lost every game
Taken all I can take
But I'll stay just the same

Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy

Sleep on, you haven't heard a word
Perhaps it's just as well
Why spoil your little dreams
Why put you through the hell

Life is no fairytale
As one day you will know
But now you're just a child
I'll stay her and watch you grow

Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy

Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy

Got all I need
Plastic teeth
A pocket full of speed
And I'm cool with the heat
I got a groovy little lady
Seems I'm waisting het time
Got a hit and a bullet
Still back in crime

Si I guess I'm gonna have to get myself together

Refrein:
But I'll never

I'll never be clever

I'll never be clever
Ooh ah ah
I'll never be clever

With a sense of humour
Some say I'm faking it all
Trying to start rumours
Some people say a moment lasts longer
I find myself at home
Settled down, write a song
I'll love to hang around
In black people's places
Fascinated staring at faces
Holy mama, make me concentrate
Got to write a song
And I got to create

Going down the line, my head up high enz."

Well I do

The reminders, pull the floor from your feet
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it isn't there

Maar niet te ver en rustig aan
Ik weet nog niet echt wat het doet

Dit is mijn hart
Mijn houten hart
De dames voor u hebben het alvast verzwaard
Dus wees maar lief
Het kan geen kwaad
En stelen lijkt me niet de moeite waard

Je kan er goed op laten lopen
Dan doet het niet zo'n pijn
Als toen ik het origineel nog had
Het gouden, goud maar klein
Dit hart, ik heb het pas gekocht
Bewust een tweedehands
Je blijft geen gouden kopen
Ook al had je wel de kans

Dit is mijn hart
Mijn houten hart
De dames voor u hebben het alvast verzwaard
Dus wees maar lief
Het kan geen kwaad
En stelen lijkt me niet de moeite waard

Het voordeel van een houten hart
Je bent voorzichtiger met vuur
De splinters zijn voor anderen
Er hoeft geen slot op en is dus helemaal niet duur

Dit is mijn hart

Laat mij je dan weer vinden

Zolang ik jou echt bij me heb
Heb ik de volmaakte liefde hier
Drink ik uit een pure waterbron
En slaap onder een deken van geluk
Jij bent het goudste zonlicht
Een volmaakt helder kristal
Zo schitterend dat het licht ervan
Me soms dreigt te verblinden

Maar ga niet weg
Ga nooit bij me weg
En als je ooit verdwijnt
Laat mij je dan weer vinden

Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Boys, you can break
You'll find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heart

On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the guide and the weight of her world

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers

Just like I know a good man should

You know I'm free, free now, baby

Oh, I'm free, free, free now
I'm free from your spell
And now that it's all over
All I can do is wish you well"

 Dat is wat ik doe
 Bekend terein, vrumd genog
 Hoe 't rök en vuuld, hoe het lek en klinkt
 Elke straote ken ik, elke bocht
 Jij woont hier ver vandaan, zeggen ze elders in het land
 Dan zeg ik, insgelijks, u ook, a'j 't zien van dizze kant

 Hier kom ik weg, veur mien hiele leben
 Ben 'k met dizze horizon verweben
 Hier kom ik weg, hier stiet ons huus
 Bliekbar kom ik daor altied weer terecht
 Hier kom ik weg

 Hier bennen die paar mensen
 zunder wie 't niks is
 Bekend gedrag, vrumd genog
 De wiede wereld is der wel,
 via draod en golven
 waormet ik vaak
 naor gruuner grös heb zocht
 Naor de verste verten
 wul ik altied wel hen
 Mar dat gevuul dreijt zich weer um
 zo gauw as ik daor ben

 Ruumte smoort de drokte
 Stilte gef rust
 Ben me der nie alle dagen
 hielmaol van bewust
 Hoe graag ik hier mag wezen
 Gruuntesoep met worst!
 Leven hier helpt net zo goed
 as drinken tegen de dörst

 Hier kom ik weg, hier stiet ons huus
 Bliekbar kom ik daor altied weer terecht
 Hier kom ik weg"
673,674,Son Of A Preacher Man,Dusty Springfield,1968,"Billy-Ray was a preacher's son
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along
When they gathered 'round and started talkin'
That's when Billy would take me walkin'
A-through the backyard we'd go walkin'
Then he'd look into my eyes
Lord knows to my surprise

The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes he was, he was
Ooh, yes he was

Being good isn't always easy
No matter how hard I try
When he started sweet-talkin' to me
He'd come and tell me everything is all right
He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right
Can I get away again tonight?

The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes he was, he was
(Ooh...) Lord knows he was
Yes he was

How well I remember
The look that was in his eyes
Stealin' kisses from me on the sly
Takin' time to make time
Tellin' me that he's all mine
Learnin' from each other's knowing
Lookin' to see how much we've grown

And the only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes he was, he was
Ooh, yes he was

The only one who could ever reach me
He was the sweet-talking son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
I kissed the son of a preacher man
The only one who could ever move me
The sweet-lovin' son of a preacher man
The only one who could ever groove me
Ahh, ooh, ahh"
674,675,Jimmy,Boudewijn De Groot,1973,"Hoe sterk is de eenzame fietser
Die kromgebogen over zijn stuur tegen de wind
Zichzelf een weg baant?

Hoe zelfbewust de voetbalspeler
Die voor de ogen van het publiek de wedstrijd wint
Zich kampioen waant?

Hoe lacht vergenoegd de zakenman
Zonder mededogen die concurrent verslagen vindt
Zelf haast failliet gaat

En ik zit hier tevreden met die kleine op m'n schoot
De zon schijnt, er is geen reden
Met 't rotweer en met harde wind
Te gaan fietsen met dat kind

Als ie maar geen voetballer wordt
Ze schoppen 'm misschien half dood

Als ie maar geen voetballer wordt
Ze schoppen 'm misschien half dood

Why am I soft in the middle?
When the rest of my life is so hard!
I need a photo-opportunity
I want a shot at redemption
Don't want to end up a cartoon
In a cartoon graveyard

Bone-digger, bone-digger
Dogs in the moonlight
Far away, my well-lit door
Mr. Beer Belly, Beer Belly
Get these mutts away from me!
You know, I don't find this stuff amusing anymore

I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty

Got a short little span of attention
And whoa, my nights are so long!
Where's my wife and family?
What if I die here?
Who'll be my role-model?
Now that my role-model is
Gone, gone
He ducked back down the alley
With some roly-poly, little bat-faced girl
All along, along
There were incidents and accidents
There were hints and allegations

I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me Al

A man walks down the street
It's a street in a strange world
Maybe it's the Third World
Maybe it's his first time around
He doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency
He is a foreign man
He is surrounded by the sound, sound
Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterlings and orphanages
He looks around, around
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning into infinity
He says, Amen! and Hallelujah!

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me

Where there's music and there's people who are young and alive
Driving in your car, I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one, anymore

Take me out tonight
Because I want to see people and I want to see life
Driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home
Because it's not my home, it's their home and I'm welcome no more

And if a double-decker bus crashes into us
To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten ton truck kills the both of us
To die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine

Take me out tonight
Take me anywhere, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
And in the darkened underpass, I thought: 'Oh God, my chance has come at last!'
But then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask

Take me out tonight
Oh, take me anywhere, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
Driving in your car, I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one, no, I haven't got one

That's all she ever thinks about ...

Riding with the wind.

When I'm sad, she comes to me

She gives to me free.

It's alright
Take anything you want from me,
Anything.

Must have a code that you can live by

Their father's hell did slowly go by
And feed them on your dreams
The one they picked, the one you'll know by

Don't you ever ask them why
If they told you, you would cry
So just look at them back inside 
And know they love you

And you of tender years
Can't know the fears that your elders grew by
And so please help them with your youth
They seek the truth before they can die

Teach your parents well
Their children's hell will slowly go by
And feed them on your dreams
The one they picked, the one you'll know by

You dance and shake the hurt

You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
Footprints dressed in red

And the wind whispers, ""Mary""

A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere, a queen is weeping
Somewhere, a king has no wife

And the wind, it cries, ""Mary""

The traffic lights, they turn blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life that lived is dead

And the wind screams, ""Mary""

Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past?
And with this crutch, its old age and its wisdom
It whispers, ""No, this will be the last""

And the wind cries, ""Mary"""

She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Céilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand

Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl"

692,693,Bring Me To Life,Evanescence,2003,"How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core where I've become so numb
Without a soul, my spirit sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

(Wake me up) Wake me up inside
(I can't wake up) Wake me up inside
(Save me) Call my name and save me from the dark
(Wake me up) Bid my blood to run
(I can't wake up) Before I come undone
(Save me) Save me from the nothing I've become

Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life

(Wake me up) Wake me up inside
(I can't wake up) Wake me up inside
(Save me) Call my name and save me from the dark
(Wake me up) Bid my blood to run
(I can't wake up) Before I come undone
(Save me) Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life
(I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside)
Bring me to life

Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love, darling
Only you are the life among the dead

All this time I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here (There must be something more)
Bring me to life

(Wake me up) Wake me up inside
(I can't wake up) Wake me up inside
(Save me) Call my name and save me from the dark
(Wake me up) Bid my blood to run
(I can't wake up) Before I come undone
(Save me) Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life
I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside
Bring me to life"

Get out of my life
Put on that crazy raincoat
You're gonna need it tonight
Get out of my parlour
For I cut you with a knife
Don't want your disease
Don't need your silly jive

I was an innocent by-stander
I was middle of the roadman for you
Then you took me for a ride, now baby
Showed me all the things you could do
I always listen to the good looking lady
A mistake I won't make no more
'Cause you might be a goodlooking lady
You're rotten to the core

I've been under your influence
Under your spell too long
Now people keep me at a distance
Everything I do is wrong
My brain's disintegrating
Devils singing my song
This cannot continue
This cannot go on

I was an innocent by-stander
I was middle of the roadman for you
Then you took me for a ride, now baby
Showed me all the things you could do
I always listen to the good looking lady
A mistake I won't make no more

You're rotten to the core

You're nothing but a long blond animal"

Got all these herbs don't mean a fucking thing
I am the little witch, with the magic tricks
Mistrust the white house, come and get your fix

It's not about the numbers, what you feel is real
Crystals, rays of light, the taste of orange peel
Open the mind, change the mind, that's how we achieve
Can't hurry to try right, it's what I believe

Witch doctor

I taste the green when you come here and complain
I'll give you cleanliness, while I'll make it rain
I'm a corpse eating vulture, who tells you how to feel
Don't trust the white coats, I'll make you a better deal

Put a needle in the cheek so turn the other one
Come back tomorrow, because we'll never get it done
Open the mind, change the mind, that's how we achieve
Can't hurry to try right, it's what I believe

Oh, is it a dream?

How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?

Is it a kind of shadow
Reaching into the night
Wandering over the hills unseen
Or is it a dream?

There's a high wind in the trees
A cold sound in the air
And nobody ever knows when you go
And where do you start
Oh, into the dark

Die ik heb afgelegd
Na het licht
Op zoek naar het donker

Verlangen naar verlangen
Uit dat harnas van spijt
Jaloezie
En belangen

Onderweg spuwden stuurlui
Aan wal hun gal
Zij hebben nooit iets bereikt
Ik bleef eigenwijs

En toen toen zag ik jou
Jij bent zoveel voor me geweest
Een moeder een dochter
De mooiste vrouw

Maar als altijd met iemand
Die nooit iets zeker weet
Won mijn twijfel van ons geluk
Maar vanavond ben ik hier terug

En ik vraag je

Heb me lief heb me lief
Heb dit lichaam lief
Bemin mij bevrijd mij
Van het duister in mijn hoofd
Mijn straat loopt hier dood

Wat achtervolgde mij hier naar toe
Was het de prijs van de roem
Of het verlangen voor één nacht
Iemand te vertrouwen

Of was het die hyena die jakhals
Die wacht tot ik neerval
En waarvan ik dacht
Dat het een vriend was

Maar zijn wij samen niet sterker
Dan alles wat mij bedreigt
Ik sta klaar voor de strijd
Met als wapen de waarheid

En dat is

Heb me lief heb me lief
Heb dit lichaam lief
Bemin mij bevrijd mij
Van dat gevoel van schuld
Verraad mij met een kus

Heb me lief heb me lief
Ik weet meer vragen kan ik niet
Wij verzoenen ons vannacht
Bemin mij streel mij heel mij
Heb me lief"

Where the river runs high above the rooftops

I was standing in a valley of rock
Up to my belly in an early fog
I was looking for the road to a green painted house
In the Dutch mountains
In the Dutch mountains

Met a woman in a valley of stone
She was painting roses on the walls of her home
And the moon is a coin with the head of the queen
Of the Dutch mountains

I lost a button of my shirt today
It fell on the ground and it was rolling away
Like a trail leading me back
To the Dutch mountains
To the Dutch mountains

He was looking for the wind
But he didn't know how

't is twee uur 's nachts, we liggen op bed.
In een hotel in een stad waar niemand ons hoort,
waar niemand ons kent en niemand ons stoort.
Op de vloer ligt een lege fles wijn
en kledingstukken die van jou of mij kunnen zijn.
Een schemering, de radio zacht en deze nacht heeft alles,
wat ik van een nacht verwacht.

Het is een nacht, die je normaal alleen in films ziet
Het is een nacht, die wordt bezongen in het mooiste lied
Het is een nacht waarvan ik dacht dat ik hem nooit beleven zou
maar vannacht beleef ik hem met jou. -wo ho wo ho-

Ik ben nog wakker en ik staar naar het plafond,
en ik denk aan hoe de dag lang geleden begon
Het zomaar er vandoor gaan met jou,
niet wetend waar de reis eindigen zou.
Nu lig ik hier in een wildvreemde stad,
en heb net de nacht van mijn leven gehad.
Maar helaas er komt weer licht door het raam,
hoewel voor ons de wereld vannacht heeft stil gestaan.

Het is een nacht, die je normaal alleen in films ziet
Het is een nacht, die wordt bezongen in het mooiste lied
Het is een nacht waarvan ik dacht dat ik hem nooit beleven zou
maar vannacht beleef ik hem met jou. -wo ho wo ho-

Een lied blijft slechts bij woorden,
de film is in scene gezet.
Maar deze nacht met jou is levensecht.

708,709,Lyin' Eyes,Eagles,1975,"City girls just seem to find out early
How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man, and she won't have to worry
She'll dress up all in lace and go in style

Late at night a big old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice

So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feelin' down
But he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin'
She is headed for the cheatin' side of town

You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

On the other side of town a boy is waiting
With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night anticipating
Cause he makes her feel the way she used to feel

She rushes to his arms, they fall together
She whispers that it's only for a while
She swears that soon she'll be coming back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile

You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And stares out at the stars up in the sky
Another night, it's gonna be a long one
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry

She wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy
She's so far gone, she feels just like a fool

My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things
You set it up so well, so carefully
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things
You're still the same old girl you used to be

You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes
Honey, you can't hide your lyin' eyes"

Mommy, why does everybody have a bomb?"
710,711,Where Is The Love,Black Eyed Peas,2003,"What's wrong with the world, mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma

Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK

But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah

Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach
Or would you turn the other cheek?

Father, Father, Father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love? (love)

Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)

Where is the love, the love, the love?

It just ain't the same, all ways are changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?

Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones
With the ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone?

So I can ask myself really what is goin' wrong
In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover

The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug
If you never know truth then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't know)
Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't know)
Where's the love, y'all (come on yeah)

People killin', people dyin'

Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)

Where is the love, the love, the love?

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction

Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images, is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinemas

Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity?
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality?
Instead in spreading love we're spreading animosity
Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity

That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive till love is found (now ask yourself)

Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?

Father, Father, Father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love?

One world, one world (We only got)
One world, one world (That's all we got)
One world, one world
And something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with the wo-wo-world, yeah

711,712,Land Of Confusion,Genesis,1986,"I must've dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street

Now, did you read the news today?
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fires still alight
They're burning into the night

There's too many men, too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round

Use them and let's start trying (Oh-oh-oh)
To make it a place worth living in

Ooh, Superman, where are you now?
Well, everything's gone wrong somehow
The men of steel, men of power
They're losing control by the hour

This is the time, this is the place
So we look for the future
But there's not much love to go round
Tell me why this is the land of confusion

This is the world we live in (Oh-oh-oh)
And these are the hands we're given (Oh-oh-oh)
Use them and let's start trying (Oh-oh-oh)
To make it a place worth living in

I remember long ago
Ooh, when the sun was shining
And the stars were bright all through the night
And the sound of your laughter as I held you tight
So long ago

I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know we'll never keep

Too many men, there's too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see this is the land of confusion?

Well, this is the world we live in (Oh-oh-oh)
And these are the hands we're given (Oh-oh-oh)
Use them and let's start trying (Oh-oh-oh)
To make it a place worth fighting for

This is the world we live in (Oh-oh-oh)

Stand up and let's start showing (Oh-oh-oh)
Just where our lives are going to"

Just relax, take it easy
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to know

Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old
But I'm happy

I was once like you are now
And I know that it's not easy
To be calm
When you've found something going on

But take your time, think a lot
Why, think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow
But your dreams may not

How can I try to explain?
When I do he turns away again
It's always been the same
Same old story

From the moment I could talk
I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way and I know
That I have to go away
I know I have to go

It's not time to make a change
Just sit down, take it slowly
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to go through

Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old
But I'm happy

All the times that I cried
Keeping all the things I knew inside
It's hard
But it's harder to ignore it

If they were right, I'd agree
But it's them they know, not me
Now there's a way and I know
That I have to go away
I know I have to go"

In a screaming ring of faces I seen her standing in the light
She had a ticket for the races yeah just like me she was a victim of the night

She took off a silver locket she said remember me by this
She put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kiss
And in the roar of dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk away
I could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me stay

Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love yeah-eah love love love

I'd like to try to read your palm
I used to think I was some kind of Gypsy boy
Before I let you take me home

Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began
To laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again

Well you know that I love to live with you
But you make me forget so very much
I forget to pray for the angels
And then the angels forget to pray for us

Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began
To laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again

We met when we were almost young
Deep in the green lilac park
You held on to me like I was a crucifix
As we went kneeling through the dark

Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began
To laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again

Your letters they all say that you're beside me now
Then why do I feel alone?
I'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web
Is fastening my ankle to a stone

Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began
To laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again

For now I need your hidden love
I'm cold as a new razor blade
You left when I told you I was curious
I never said that I was brave

Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began
To laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again

Oh, you are really such a pretty one
I see you've gone and changed your name again
And just when I climbed this whole mountainside
To wash my eyelids in the rain!

Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began
To laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again"

719,720,What It Is,Mark Knopfler,2000,"The drinking dens are spilling out
There's staggering in the square
There's lads and lasses falling about
And a crackling in the air
Down around the dungeon doors
The shelters and the queues
Everybody's looking for
Somebody's arms to fall into

It's what it is
It's what it is now

There's frost on the graves and the monuments
But the taverns are warm in town
People curse the government
And shovel hot food down
Lights are out in the city hall
The castle and the keep
The moon shines down upon it all
The legless and the sleepless

Cold on the tollgate
With the wagons creeping through
Cold on the tollgate
God knows what I could do with you

It's what it is
It's what it is now

The Garison sleeps in the citadel
With the ghost and the ancient stones
High on the parapet
A Scottish piper stands alone
High on the wind
The highland drums begin to roll
And something from the past just comes
And stares into my soul

Cold on the tollgate
With the Caledonian Blues
Cold on the tollgate
God knows what I could do with you

It's what it is
It's what it is now
What it is
It's what it is now now

There's a chink of light, there's a burning wick
There's a lantern in the tower
Wee Willie Winkie with a candlestick
Still writing songs in the wee wee hours
On Charlotte Street 
I take a walking stick from my hotel
The ghost of Dirty Dick
Is still in search of Little Nell

It's what it is
It's what it is now
Oh what it is
What it is now now now"
720,721,Zij Maakt Het Verschil,Poema's,2001,"Ze is geen medicijn tegen het tikken van de klok
Geen hoop, geen gids
Geen haven in de nacht
Geen bron in de woestijn als je kapot gaat van de dorst
Niet een glimlach op je aller slechtste grap

Ze is geen hitrefrein dat van de steigers klinkt
Niet de aller duurste wijn die je zonder kater drinkt
Geen bloementuin in bloei
Niet een uit duizend nachten
Geen uitgestoken hand
Niet het eind van al mijn wachten

Nee meer nog dan ik eigenlijk toegeven wil,
Zij maakt het verschil

Ze is geen slap excuus voor wat ik graag had willen zijn
Geen droom, geen doel
Geen stok om mee te slaan
Geen enkele garantie voor een lang gelukkig leven
Ze is geen antwoord op de vraag van ons bestaan

Niet de mooiste symfonie onder de film genaamd 'Wij twe'en""
Niet het schone koele bed dat mijn koortsen weg kan nemen
Niet het ritme van mijn hart, niet het zuiverste geweten
Ze kwam niet op het juiste moment,
En dat kan me ook niet schelen

Want meer nog dan ik eigelijk toegeven wil,
Zij maakt het verschil

Tussen alles wat ik had en hoe dat opeens ging leven
Wat met potlood staat geschetst kan met kleur worden in getekend
Tussen nooit iets aan de hand en van alles te beleven
Tussen nooit en misschien, heel soms
En tussen ik en ons
Zoveel zang en zoveel woorden en moet allemaal gezegd
Maar wat ze ook proberen geen vergelijking is terecht
Misschien is het wat simpel maar alles wat ik horen wil is

Zij maakt het verschil
Zij (zij, zij) maakt het verschil

Want ze is geen goed gesprek
Waar geen hond op zit te wachten
Niet de vlag waar ik onder strijd
Geen advies bij al mijn klachten
Niet de aller laatste uitweg waar wij allang niet meer aan dachten

Maar meer nog dan ik eigenlijk toegeven wil,
Zij maakt het verschil
Zij maakt het verschil

721,722,A Night Like This,Caro Emerald,2009,"From where you are
You see the smoke start to arise where they play cards
And you walk over softly moving past the guards
The stakes are getting higher, you can feel it in your heart

He calls your bluff
He is the ace, you never thought he played that much
And now it's more than all these cards you want to touch
You never know if winning this could really be enough

Take a look, beyond the moon you see the stars (Ooohooohooohooo)
And when you look around, you know the room by heart

I have never dreamed it, have you ever dreamed a night like this?
I cannot believe it, I may never see a night like this

When everything you think is incomplete
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek
Could you ever dream it?
I have never dreamed, dreamed a night like this

How many times
Have I been waiting by the door to hear these chimes?
To hear that someone debonaire has just arrived
And opened up to see my world before my eyes

That silhouette
Creates an image on the night I can't forget
It has the scent of something special, I can't rest
If I resist temptation, oh, I know for sure that I will lose the bet

I walk away and suddenly it seems I'm not alone (Ooohooohooohooo)
In front of me he stands, I stop, before he goes

I have never dreamed it, have you ever dreamed a night like this?
I cannot believe it, I may never see a night like this

When everything you think is incomplete
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek
Could you ever dream it?
I have never dreamed, dreamed a night like this

Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers undercover of the street

You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you

Off in the night while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
Waging wars to shake the poet and the beat

I hope it's gonna make you notice
I hope it's gonna make you notice

Am I your pride and joy?
Mother please if you THINK say I am
And if while in the course of my duty
I perform an unfortunate take
Would you punish me so
Unbelievably so
Never again will I make that mistake
This feeling inside me could never deny me
The right to be wrong if I choose
And this pleasure I get
From say winning a bet
Is to lose

When I'm drinking my Bonaparte Shandy
Eating more than enough apple pies
Will I glance at my screen
And see real human beings
Starve to death right in front of my eyes

Nothing old, nothing new, nothing ventured
Nothing gained, nothing still-born or lost
Nothing further than proof, nothing wilder than youth
Nothing older than time, nothing sweeter than wine
Nothing physically recklessly, hopelessly blind
Nothing I couldn't say
Nothing why 'cause today
Nothing rhymed

This feeling inside me could never deny me
The right to be wrong if I choose
And this pleasure I get
From say winning a bet
Is to lose

Nothing good, nothing bad, nothing ventured
Nothing gained, nothing still-born or lost

Nothing older than time, nothing sweeter than wine
Nothing physically recklessly, hopelessly blind

Like an eagle you circled, in perfect purple
So how come things move on, how come cars don't slow
When it feels like the end of my world
When I should but I can't let you go?

But when I'm cold, cold
Oh when I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me when I'm in shadow
There's a feeling you give me, an everglow

Like brothers in blood, sisters who ride
And we swore on that night we'd be friends till we die
But the changing of winds, and the way waters flow
Life as short as the falling of snow
And now I'm gonna miss you I know

But when I'm cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know that you're with me and the way you will show
And you're with me wherever I go
And you give me this feeling this everglow

Oh- I I I I
What I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Yeah I live for this feeling this everglow

So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh the light that you left me will everglow"

Black-roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes
Dawn-light smiles on you, leaving my contentment

I'll wait in this place
Where the sun never shines
Wait in this place
Where the shadows run from themselves

You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning

I'll wait in the queue
When the trains come back
Lie with you
Where the shadows run from themselves

At the party, she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings

I'll sleep in this place
With the lonely crowd
Lie in the dark
Where the shadows run from themselves"

In the midnight hour, I can feel your power
Just like a prayer, you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice, feels like flying
I close my eyes, oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes, Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there

Like a child, you whisper softly to me
You're in control, just like a child, now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream, let the choir sing

The scene of death is lying just below

The mountain cuts off the town from view
Like a cancer growth is removed by skill
Let it be revealed

A waterfall
His madrigal
An inland sea
His symphony

Undinal songs urge the sailors on
'Til lured by the siren's cry

Now as the river dissolves in sea
So Neptune has claimed another soul
And so with gods and men
The sheep remain inside their pen
Until the shepherd leads his flock away

The sands of time were eroded by
The river of constant change"
729,730,The Fool On The Hill,Beatles,1967,"Day after day, alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Ohh oh-oh-oh-oh ohh-oh-oh
Round and round and round and round and round
He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fool
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Ohhhh
Round and round and round and round and
Ohhhh"

It happened just the other day
It was gettin' kind of long
I coulda said it was in my way

But I didn't and I wonder why
I feel like letting my freak flag fly
Yes, I feel like I owe it to someone

Must be because I had the flu for Christmas
And I'm not feeling up to par
It increases my paranoia
Like looking in my mirror and seeing a police car

But I'm not giving in an inch to fear
'Cause I've promised myself this year
I feel like I owe it to someone

Woo!

When I finally get myself together
I'm gonna get down in that sunny southern weather

And I find a space inside to laugh
Separate the wheat from the chaff
I feel like I owe it to someone, yeah"

Trying to cover my shadow
A notion growing inside
And all the others seem shallow

All this running around
Bearing down on my shoulders

It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound

But he could play a guitar just like a-ringing a bell

Go go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Johnny B. Goode!

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineer would see him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
The people passing by, they would stop and say
""Oh my, but that little country boy could play""

Go go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Johnny B. Goode!

His mother told him, ""Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big ol' band
Many people comin' from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name'll be in lights
Sayin' 'Johnny B. Goode tonight!'""

Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs and still-frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

While darkness takes the afternoon
I know that they won't last forever
But real ones fade away to soon

I still cry sometimes when I remember you
I still cry sometimes when I hear your name
I said goodbye and I know you're all right now
But when the leaves start falling down I still cry

It's just that I recall September
It's just that I still hear your song
It's just I can't seem to remember
Forever more those days are gone

I still cry sometimes when I remember you
I still cry sometimes when I hear your name
I said goodbye and I know you're all right now
But when the leaves start falling down I still cry

verandert de kleur van mijn dag
't is niet te geloven
van zwart als ze boos is
tot blauwer dan blauw als ze lacht

de zon hangt voortdurend verliefd om haar heen
en de maan laat haar nooit een seconde alleen 
een woord van haar lippen
kan telkens weer wonderen doen
't is niet te voorspellen
soms klinkt ze als onweer
en soms als een zonnig seizoen 

maar hoe hard het ook vriest
ze is zo weer ontdooid
zolang ze bij mij is verveel ik me nooit 
want zij

zij is de zon en de maan voor mij
zij heeft het beste van allebei
zo mysterieus
en zo warm tegelijk
en ze doet iets met mij
ze is vrij
vrij om te gaan maar ze blijft bij mij

zij is de eb en de vloed erbij
ze is onweerstaanbaar
ze zegt me gewoon wat ze vindt
een vrouw en een kind
ze is wind en windstilte
en zij
zij hoort bij mij 
en zij opent een wereld voor mij

zij is de zon op mijn huid en de regen
wind mee en wind tegen
zij zit in alles voor mij
ze maakt me blij
zij houdt me vast maakt me vrij
zij is er altijd
zij maakt me deel van haar grote geheel
zij is de betere helft
van mij

Holds a lot of rain
Love hurts, ooh ooh love hurts

But even so
I know a thing or two
I learned from you
I really learned a lot
Really learned a lot
Love is like a flame
It burns you when it's hot
Love hurts, ooh ooh love hurts

Some fools think of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
They're not fooling me

I know it isn't true
I know it isn't true
Love is just a lie

Saw these stars crashing

I'm a mess without my little China girl
Wake up in the morning, where's my little China girl?

Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes

I'll ruin everything you are
You know, I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world

Gotta keep on going, looking straight out on the road
Can't worry 'bout what's behind you or what's coming for you further up the road
I try not to hold on to what is gone, I try to do right what is wrong
I try to keep on keeping on
Yeah I just keep on keeping on

Calling out for me
These shackles I've made in an attempt to be free
Be it for reason, be it for love
I won't take the easy road

I've woken up in a hotel room, my worries as big as the moon
Having no idea who or what or where I am
Something good comes with the bad
A song's never just sad
There's hope, there's a silver lining
Show me my silver lining
Show me my silver lining

Calling out for me
These shackles I've made in an attempt to be free

754,755,Through The Barricades,Spandau Ballet,1986,"Mother doesn't know where love has gone,
She says it must be youth that keeps us feeling strong.
See it in her face that's turned to ice,
And when she smiles she shows the lines of sacrifice.
And now I know what they're saying as our sun begins to fade,
And we made our love on wasteland and through the barricades.

Father made my history,
He fought for what he thought would set us somehow free.
He taught me what to say in school,
I learned it off by heart but now that's torn in two.
And now I know what they're saying in the music of the parade,
And we made our love on wasteland and through the barricades.

Born on different sides of life,
But we feel the same and feel all of this strife,
So come to me when I'm asleep and we'll cross the line and dance upon the streets.
And now I know what they're saying as the drums begin to fade,
And we made our love on wasteland and through the barricades.

Oh, turn around and I'll be there,
Well there's a scar right through my heart but I'll bare it again.
Oh, I thought we were the human race but we were just another borderline case,
And the stars reach down and tell us that there's always one escape.
Oh, I don't know where love has gone,
And in this troubled land desperation keeps us strong.
Friday's child is full of soul,
With nothing left to lose there's everything to go.
And now I know what they're saying,
It's a terrible beauty we've made,
So we make our love on wasteland and through the barricades.
And now I know what they're saying as our hearts go to their graves,
And we made our love on wasteland and through the barricades."

In such an early song?
I've heard a rumour from ground control
Oh no, don't say it's true

They got a message from the action man:
""I'm happy, hope you're happy, too
I've loved all I've needed love
Sordid details following""

The shrieking of nothing is killing just
Pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I
Ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but this planet is glowing, glowing, glowing, glowing, glowing...

Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in Heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

Time and again, I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
I'm happy, hope you're happy, too
One flash of light but no smoking pistol

I've never done good things
I've never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now

Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in Heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

My mother said, ""To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom""
My mother said, ""To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom""

You'd better not mess with Major Tom""

We bought our own praise with easy goals
And we're off to sell it as the greatest story told

Yet another ungraceful evening
Another man's faith
An easy foe
And we're off to shiver in the face of the unknown

Though we long together for the tables to turn
Though we pray together for the bridges to burn
Still we stay cold

Yet another ungrateful weekday
We're caught in a game where the winner takes all
And we're off to tell it as the greatest story told

Though we long together for the tables to turn
Though we pray together for the bridges to burn
Still we stay cold

We got carried away by it
We got carried away from home
We got carried away by it
We got carried away from home"

I need someone's arms to hold and squeeze me tight

Because I need your love so bad

I need some lips to feel next to mine
Need someone to stand up - to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin'
And when the lights are low - and it's time to go
That's when I need your love so bad

So why don't you give it up, baby and bring it home to me
Or write it on a piece of paper, woman - so it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me - and stop drivin' me mad
Whoa, because I - I need your love so bad

Need a soft voice - just to talk to me at night
Don't want you to worry, baby
I know we can make everything all right
Listen to my plea, baby, come on bring it to me
'Cause I need - your love so bad
Baby, I need, I need - woman, I need your love so bad"

And practiced all the things I would say

But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer, the more it shows you really care
Right? 
Yeah!

Now, I'll relate this little bit
It happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night she knocks on my door
She's drunk again and looking to score

Now, I know I should say no
But it's kind of hard when she's ready to go
I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb
I'm just a sucker with no self esteem

A spider web, and I'm caught in the middle
So I turned to run

I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well if I ever caused you trouble
Oh no, I never meant to do you harm

Everything of love between us,
Will get us trough the night
All the things we've lost will teach us,
See the pretty things in life
All the places that we've been to
The people we relate to
All the love that we give in to

Blow the tears from our Eyes

776,777,Mooi,Marco Borsato,2015,"Hoe val je in slaap
Hoe begint je dag
Open je je ogen
Met een traan of met een lach

En kijk je om je heen
En zie je dan de zon
Of zoek je achter alles
Naar de schaduw op de grond

En leef je voor geluk
Of sterf je van verdriet
En voelt dat als een keuze
Of heb jij die keuze niet

Het maakt niet echt iets uit
Of dat de waarheid is of niet
Het is hoe jij het ziet

Hoe mooi
Kan het leven zijn
Het is maar hoe je kijkt
Het is maar wat je droomt
Hoe mooi
Is jouw werkelijkheid
Jij bent net zo rijk
Zo rijk als je je voelt

Weet je wat je hebt
Is de cirkel rond
Zie je wat er staat
Of mis je enkel wat er stond
Krijg je wat je wilt
Of zelfs meer dan wat je vroeg
Ben je tevreden met het minste
Of is het meeste niet genoeg
Raak je verwonderd van de sneeuw
Van het ruisen van de wind
Geniet je van de vogels
Van het lachen van een kind

Creëer je je geluk
Want binnen in jezelf
Is waar het eindigt en begint

Hoe mooi
Kan het leven zijn
Het is maar hoe je kijkt
Het is maar wat je droomt
Hoe mooi
Is jouw werkelijkheid
Jij bent net zo rijk
Zo rijk als je je voelt
Zo rijk als je je voelt

Hoe mooi
Kan het leven zijn
Het is maar hoe je kijkt
Het is maar wat je droomt
Hoe mooi
Is jouw werkelijkheid
Jij bent net zo rijk
Zo rijk als je je voelt
Zo rijk als je je voelt
Zo rijk als je je voelt"
777,778,Take This Waltz,Leonard Cohen,1988,"Now in Vienna there's ten pretty women
There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows
There's a tree where the doves go to die
There's a piece that was torn from the morning
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws

Oh I want you, I want you, I want you
On a chair with a dead magazine
In the cave at the tip of the lily
In some hallways where love's never been
On a bed where the moon has been sweating
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take its broken waist in your hand

This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
With its very own breath of brandy and Death
Dragging its tail in the sea

There's a concert hall in Vienna
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking
They've been sentenced to death by the blues
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture
With a garland of freshly cut tears?
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take this waltz it's been dying for years

There's an attic where children are playing
Where I've got to lie down with you soon
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns
In the mist of some sweet afternoon
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow
All your sheep and your lilies of snow
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Take this waltz, take this waltz
With its ""I'll never forget you, you know!""

This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
With its very own breath of brandy and Death
Dragging its tail in the sea

And I'll dance with you in Vienna
I'll be wearing a river's disguise
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder,
My mouth on the dew of your thighs
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook,
With the photographs there, and the moss
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty
My cheap violin and my cross
And you'll carry me down on your dancing
To the pools that you lift on your wrist
Oh my love, Oh my love
Take this waltz, take this waltz
It's yours now. It's all that there is"

Stuck in this mood, and to be honest again

I've got something to share, so much I forgot
Don't know what it means

Your Persian eyes sparkle, your lips, ruby blue, never speak a sound

Mangle my mind, love me sublime, do it in style
We all know oh yeah

You're not gonna run, babe, we only just begun, babe, to compromise
Slagged in a Bowery saloon, love's a story to serialise

784,785,Jungleland,Bruce Springsteen,1975,"The Rangers had a homecoming
In Harlem late last night
And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine
Over the Jersey state line

Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge
Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain
The Rat pulls into town, rolls up his pants
Together they take a stab at romance and disappear down Flamingo Lane

Well, the Maximum Lawman run down Flamingo
Chasing the Rat and the barefoot girl
And the kids around here look just like shadows
Always quiet, holding hands

From the churches to the jails
Tonight all is silence in the world
As we take our stand
Down in Jungleland

The midnight gangs assembled
And picked a rendezvous for the night
They'll meet 'neath that giant Exxon sign
That brings this fair city light

Man, there's an opera out on the Turnpike
There's a ballet being fought out in the alley
Until the local cop's cherry top
Rips this holy night

The street's alive as secret debts are paid
Contacts made, they vanished unseen
Kids flash guitars just like switchblades
Hustling for the record machine

The hungry and the hunted
Explode into rock 'n' roll bands
That faced off against each other out in the street
Down in Jungleland

In the parking lot
The visionaries dress in the latest rage
Inside, the backstreet girls
Are dancing to the records that the DJ plays

Lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners
Desperate as the night moves on
With just one look and a whisper
They're gone

Beneath the city, two hearts beat
Soul engines running through a night so tender
In a bedroom locked, in whispers of soft
Refusal, and then surrender

In the tunnels uptown
The Rat's own dream guns him down
The shots echo down them hallways in the night
No one watches when the ambulance pulls away
Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light

Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz
Between what's flesh and what's fantasy
And the poets down here don't write nothing at all
They just stand back and let it all be

And in the quick of the night, they reach for their moment
And try to make an honest stand
But they wind up wounded, not even dead
Tonight in Jungleland"

It's been beaten up and used and more
It's been kicked a hundred thousand times
It's keeping all the memories behind

If you read the lines between the paint
Look beyond the cracks that store away
It's hidden in the windows of the walls
Right behind the eyes that saw it all

Given all the facts of circumstance
I did not believe that a romance
Would show itself in all this dark and blue
That's the only place I ever knew

You put me outside my safety-zone
Outside all the lines that made my home
To find out that no one really lives 
Without giving what it is you give

A miracle looking in my life
A mirror-ball showing me all these faces
A miracle looking in my life, after all
A miracle looking in my life
A mirror-ball showing me all these faces
A miracle

I've been living underneath my skin
Everything I felt I kept it in
It carried all the words without a sound 
It got me, it almost got too loud

But now that my arms are holding on
To someone as sacred as a song
To the one who wants to be my own
I have found that blood can come from stones

A miracle looking in my life
A mirror-ball showing me all these faces
A miracle looking in my life, after all
A miracle looking in my life
A mirror-ball showing me all these faces
A miracle

A miracle looking in my life
A mirror-ball showing me all these faces
A miracle looking in my life, after all
A miracle looking in my life
A mirror-ball showing me all these faces
A miracle looking in my life, after all
A miracle looking in my life
A mirror-ball showing me all these faces
A miracle?

Someone put a lock on this old door
It's been beaten up and used and more
It's been kicked a hundred thousand times
It's keeping all the memories behind"

Can you hear me, can you hear me
Through the dark night far away
I am dying, forever crying
To be with you, who can say

Can you hear me, can you hear me
Through the dark night far away
I am dying, forever crying
To be with you, who can say

We are sailing, we are sailing

Bet you're sittin' drinkin' coffee, yawnin' sleepily

Just to let you know
I'm gonna be home soon
I'm kinda awkward and afraid
Time has changed your point of view

How you gonna see me now?
Please don't see me ugly babe
'Cause I know I let you down
In oh so many ways

How you gonna see me now?
Since we've been on our own
Are you gonna love the man
When the man gets home

Listen darlin', now I'm heading for the west
Straightened out my head but my old heart is still a mess

Yes, I'm worried honey
Guess that's natural though
It's like I'm waiting for a welcome sign
Like a hobo in the snow

How you gonna see me now?
Please don't see me ugly babe
'Cause I know I let you down
In oh so many ways

How you gonna see me now?
Since we've been on our own
Are you gonna love the man
When the man gets home

And just like the first time
We're just strangers again
I might have grown out of style
In the place I've been

And just like the first time
I'll be shakin' inside
When I walk in the door
There'll be no place to hide

How you gonna see me now?
Please don't see me ugly babe
'Cause I know I let you down
In oh so many ways

How you gonna see me now?
Since we've been on our own
Are you gonna love the man
When the man gets home"

And you should know I'd suffer the same
If I lose you... my heart will be broken

But if I tell the world, I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you

Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops and my back begins to tingle
Finally could this be it?

Or should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements

Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?

And a world of dreams
You speak the language of love

You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone

I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Oh, tear us apart baby
Baby, I would rather be dead

The start of every night and every day
In your eyes I get lost
I get washed away
Just as long as I'm here in your arms
I could be in no better place

Better than all the rest
Better than anyone

Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me

I'll cross the stream

I have a dream, a fantasy
To help me through reality
And my destination makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness still another mile

797,798,Tears Dry On Their Own,Amy Winehouse,2007,"All I can ever be to you is a darkness that we knew
And this regret I got accustomed to
Once it was so right when we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night

I knew I hadn't met my match but every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility you don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away, I have no capacity

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm gone
And in your way in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

I don't understand, why do I stress a man
When there's so many bigger things at hand
We could've never had it all, we had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal

Even if I stop wanting you, and perspective pushes true
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I cannot play myself again, I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm gone
And in your way in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

So we are history, your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm gone
And in your way in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

I wish I could say no regrets and no emotional debt
'Cause as we kiss goodbye the sun sets
So we are history, the shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze that only lovers see

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm gone
And in your way in my blue shade
My tears dry on their own

Whoa, he walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm gone
And in your way my deep shade
My tears dry on their own

He walks away the sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm gone
And in your way my deep shade
My tears dry"

And it plays until dark

It's the song of the cars
On their furious flights
But there's even romance
In the way that they dance
To beat of the lights

It's a beautiful noise
And it's a sound that I love
And it makes me feel good
Like a hand in a glove
Yes it does, yes it does
What a beautiful noise

It's a beautiful noise
Made of joy an of strife
Like a symphony played
By a passing parade
It's the music of life

What a beautiful noise

And it's beggin' for me
Just to give it a tune"

810,811,You Want It Darker,Leonard Cohen,2016,"If you are the dealer, I'm out of the game
If you are the healer, it means I'm broken and lame
If thine is the glory, then mine must be the shame
You want it darker, we kill the flame

Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name
Vilified, crucified in the human frame
A million candles burning for the help that never came
You want it darker

Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, my Lord

There's a lover in the story, but the story's still the same
There's a lullaby for suffering and a paradox to blame
But it's written in the Scriptures, and it's not some idle claim
You want it darker, we kill the flame

They're lining up to prisoners, and the guards are taking aim
I struggled with some demons, they were middle class and tame
I didn't know I had permission to murder and to maim
You want it darker

Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, my Lord

Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name
Vilified, crucified in the human frame
A million candles burning for the help that never came
You want it darker, we kill the flame

If you are the dealer, let me out of the game
If you are the healer, I'm broken and lame
If thine is the glory, mine must be the shame
You want it darker

There was somethin' going on

You do somethin' to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got somethin' goin' on

Tender love is blind, it requires a dedication
Honest love, we feel, needs no conversation
We ride it together, uh huh
Making love with each other, uh huh

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothin' if you got no one
And you just walk in the night
Slowly losin' sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry, baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one in love forever
We can ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

Just to see the girls at play.

When I am king surely I would need a queen.
And a palace and everything, yeah.

She'll be waiting in Kingston Town.

Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?

So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air

And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me
The one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me quickly?

Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas

In the days when the lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
The sweetest sight ever seen

And the night followed day
And the story tellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
The Volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the earth is old and grey, little darlin' we'll away
But my love this cannot be
For so many years have gone though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away

All your letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand

For my life
Still ahead

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking-glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds"
818,819,Kom Terug,Spinvis,2012,"Gooi een steen naar de dag zo ver als je kunt
Spoel het zout van je huid, doof het vuur
Volg het spoor dat er ligt, zoek niet wat er nooit meer is
Was het zand uit je haar, geef een naam aan ieder jaar

Drink de tranen op je hand, zwijg er van
Erf de ogen van je kind, kijk er door
Koester je geheime hart tot het eind
Reis ver, drink wijn, denk na
Lach hard, duik diep, kom terug

Droom een boot in de zon, geef hem zeilen en wind
Kus een droevige mond heel zacht, voor de dag begint
Bewaar een steen in je tas uit het land waar je sliep
Waar je de wonden opliep, waar een koninkrijk verging

Haal de parels uit de zee, geef ze weg
Vecht met alles wat je hebt, verlies het goed
Wacht dan tot het lichter wordt, je hebt de tijd
Reis ver, drink wijn, denk na
Lach hard, duik diep, kom terug

Reis ver, drink wijn, denk na
Lach hard, duik diep, kom terug
Reis ver, drink wijn, denk na
Lach hard, duik diep, kom terug

Lach hard, duik diep, kom terug
Lach hard, duik diep, kom terug"

Want we waren toen nog klein

De ene werd een voetballer
De ander werd een held
We geloofden in de toekomst
Want de meester had verteld

Jullie kunnen alles worden
Als je maar je huiswerk kent
Maar je moet geduldig wachten
Tot je later groter bent

Is dit nu later?
Is dit nu later als je groot bent
Een diploma vol met leugens
Waarop staat dat je volwassen bent
Is dit nu later?
Is dit nu later als je groot bent
Ik snap geen donder van het leven
Ik weet nog steeds niet wie ik ben
Is dit nu later?

We spelen nog verstoppertje
Maar niet meer op het plein
En de meeste zijn geworden
Wat ze toen niet wilden zijn

Wij zijn allemaal volwassen
Wie niet weg is, is gezien
En ik zou die hele choas
Nu toch helder moeten zien

Maar ik zie geen hand voor ogen
En het donker maakt mij bang
Mama, mama,
Mag het licht aan op de gang?

We will find you acting on your best behavior

It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do, I'll be right behind you
So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world

I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision
Everybody wants to rule the world

meer vraag dan antwoord

ik wou dood
ik wou begraven
met veel bloemen en bezoek
en opeens
stond zij daar voor me
en schopte haar schoenen in de hoek

in duizend stukken
op de straten van de stad

Quietly he laughs, shaking his head
Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes

""Be still, be calm, be quiet now, my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The spiderman is having you for dinner tonight""

And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering furry holes
And I know that in the morning I will wake up in the shivering cold
And the spiderman is always hungry

""Come into my parlour"" said the spider to the fly
""For I have a little something here"""

See Marshall no more they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor

Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey)

You waited this long to stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating

So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me

So, come on dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, ""Fuck you Debbie""

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
Till someone comes along on a mission and yells ""bitch""

A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass

And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you ask for me?
Well I'm back - na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in it

Up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting

""Testing, attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents, my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards

And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno

Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene (hey)

Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (hey)

There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me

Melt into my skin and I feel warm

And there ain't no mixture, that will give you back your youth
No mystic machine that makes the sand turn to gold
Like there ain't no magic word, that holds you back from getting old
I catch a branche and I break it in my hands
Like you broke my heart, oh I still can't understand
No mysterious mixture, can heal the wound you've made
Only time will bring peace to me, and now I just hate
Oh I'll break up and give it all up
No more lies, no more rainbow treasures
No more fairytales, no more games for me
It's my life, my life, a pleasure
There's just a little bit of peace in my heart
There's just a little bit of happiness I'll part
I catch a branche...
The time rolls by, the days go by
When will I learn to stop wondering why
Despairing I'm going down on my knees
I'm begging, begging, begging, oh please"

He would jump so high
Jump so high
Then he lightly touched down

Told me of the time
He worked with, with minstrel shows
Traveling throughout the south
He spoke with tears for fifteen years
How his how his dog and he
They would travel about
But his dog up and died
Got up and died
After twenty years he still grieves

He said
I dance now
At every chance in honky-tonks
For my drinks and tips
But most the time I, I spend behind these country bars
You see son I drinks a bit
Then he shook his head
Oh Lord, when he shook his head
I can swear I heard somebody saying please, please

That's Mister Bojangles
Calling Mister Bojangles

Wipe my nose, get my new boots on
I get a little warm in my heart when I think of winter
I put my hand in my father's glove

I run off where the drifts get deeper
Sleeping Beauty trips me with a frown
I hear your voice, ""You must learn to stand up
For yourself, 'cause I can't always be around.""

He says, ""When you gonna make up your mind?
When you gonna love you as much as I do?
When you gonna make up your mind?
'Cause things are gonna change so fast.
All the white horses are still in bed.
I tell you that I'll always want you near
You say that ""things change, my dear""

Boys get discovered as winter melts
Flowers competing for the sun
Years go by and I'm here still waiting
Withering where some snowman was

Mirror, mirror, where's the crystal palace?
But I only can see myself
Skating around the truth, who I am
But I know, Dad, the ice is getting thin

""When you gonna make up your mind?
When you gonna love you as much as I do?
When you gonna make up your mind?
'Cause things are gonna change so fast.
All the white horses are still in bed.""
I tell you that I'll always want you near
You say that ""things change, my dear""

Hair is grey, and the fires are burning
So many dreams on the shelf
You say, ""I wanted you to be proud of me.""
I always wanted that myself

When you gonna make up your mind?
When you gonna love you as much as I do?
When you gonna make up your mind?
'Cause things are gonna change so fast

And life is like a song

Oh, yeah, yeah, at last

My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you

I found a dream, that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

Oh, yeah, yeah

Oh, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine, at last"

Counting ten tin soldiers in a row

Do you ever see the letters that I write?
When you look up through the wire
Nikita do you count the stars at night?

And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend

It was my fate from birth
To make my mark upon the earth...

Taylor:
He calls me Charlie Mason
A stargazer am I
It seems that I was born
To chart the evening sky
They'd cut me out for baking bread
But I had other dreams instead
This baker's boy from the west country
Would join the Royal Society...

We are sailing to Philadelphia
A world away from the coaly Tyne
Sailing to Philadelphia
To draw the line
The Mason-Dixon line

Taylor:
Now you're a good surveyor, Dixon
But I swear you'll make me mad
The West will kill us both
You gullible Geordie lad
You talk of liberty
How can America be free
A Geordie and a baker's boy
In the forest of the Iroquois...

Knopfler:
Now hold your head up, Mason
See America lies there
The morning tide has raised
The capes of Delaware
Come up and feel the sun
A new morning is begun
Another day will make it clear
Why your stars should guide us here...

Mensen zijn aan de crack tegenwoordig, serieus
Ik liep laatst door het Centraal, komt er een junkie naar me toe voor een euro
""euro, kanker een euro?""
Ik zeg hier heb je twintig cent zegt-ie nee hoef je niet
Dus ik zeg, ja ja, is goed ik ken jou, ik ken je
Je komt uit Noord
""uhh ja ik kom uit Noord, hoe weet je dat, hoe weet je dat?""
Zeg ik ja ik ken je moeder ik heb m'n krantenwijk voor d'r bezorgd
""Uhh m'n moeder, m'n moeder? Ik heb 'r al vijfentwintig jaar niet gezien""
Dus ik ""zeg fok jou man, ik verkoop d'r crack stomme slet""
Kanker kanker kanker junkies op het Centraal
Serieus, enigste vette plek van Centraal is de fakking Pizzahut
En uhh, en en en en en de meeting point maar kanker die is dicht
In ieder geval Centraal is een baas, Vieze Freddy is een baas,
Baksteen is een baas, Heist Rockah is een baas.

I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang

But now I'm insecure and I care what people think

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one

It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, home-grown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree-house homes, we all would take the latter

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

To last when things are rough, it's magic
You say that I waste my time

And head back to the Milky Way?

Dream of keeping hold of
You'd better forget it
You'll never get it
She will play around and leave you
Leave you and deceive you
Better forget it
Oh you'll regret it

No you'll never change her, so leave it, leave it
Get out quick 'cause seeing is believing
It's the only way
You'll ever know

Easy lover
She'll get a hold on you believe it
Like no other
Before you know it you'll be on your knees
She's an easy lover
She'll take your heart but you won't feel it
She's like no other
And I'm just trying to make you see

You're the one that wants to hold her
Hold her and control her
You'd better forget it
You'll never get it
For she'll say there's no other
Till she finds another
Better forget it
Oh you'll regret it

And don't try to change her, just leave it, leave it
You're not the only one, ooh seeing is believing
It's the only way
You'll ever know, oh

No don't try to change her, just leave it, leave it
You're not the only one, ooh seeing is believing
It's the only way
You'll ever know, oh

She's an easy lover (she's a easy lover)
She'll get a hold on you believe it (get a hold on You)

887,888,Shape Of My Heart,Sting,1993,"He deals the cards as a meditation 
And those he plays never suspect 
He doesn't play for the money he wins 
He doesn't play for respect 

He deals the cards to find the answer 
The sacred geometry of chance 
The hidden law of a probable outcome 
The numbers lead a dance 

I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier 
I know that the clubs are weapons of war 
I know that diamonds mean money for this art 
But that's not the shape of my heart 

He may play the jack of diamonds 
He may lay the queen of spades 
He may conceal a king in his hand 
While the memory of it fades 

I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier 
I know that the clubs are weapons of war 
I know that diamonds mean money for this art 
But that's not the shape of my heart
That's not the shape
The shape of my heart

And if I told you that I loved you 
You'd maybe think there's something wrong 
I'm not a man of too many faces 
The mask I wear is one 

Those who speak know nothing 
And find out to their cost 
Like those who curse their luck in too many places 
And those who fear are lost 

I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier 
I know that the clubs are weapons of war 
I know that diamonds mean money for this art 
But that's not the shape of my heart
That's not the shape of my heart
That's not the shape
The shape of my heart"
888,889,Zandloper,Typhoon,2014,"Ik ben herboren in geschriften
Is dan gelijke realiteit
Koppel mezelf los van mijn persoon
Die loopt, drinkt, eet, schijt
Ik ben die persoon maar die persoon is mij niet
Mijn universum een projectie van wat ik gewend ben te zien zijn is blessing
Zoet is de pijn van het niet bereiken van je bestemming
Zonder afstand of tijd is meer zo iets van wat redde jij
Mijn brein is een day
In day deck op repeat
Speel mijn programma's af tot ik mijn laatste rustplaats zie
Tot ik mijn laatste rust plaats zie
Tot ik mijn laatste rustplaats zie
Brandend vlot op het water
Nog een blik naar een zinkend flacon
Lichaam in de mist voordat ik een ruwe levensvorm kies
Van het begin tot het eindpunt
Stop ik erin wat eruit moet
Toen vloog het erna tot over me tempel nu kan ik niet meer naar huis toe
Kan het voorlopig wat anders
Zo stond het niet in mijn draaiboek
Zie wat de man met de zeis doet
Zie wat die man met de tijd doet
Een nieuwe dag
Een nieuwe start
400 kilo watt beats voor bakkes
Voel voor je oooee
Voel voor je hart
Zo fresh, zo clean
Zo breng ik de rakkes
Verheerlijk niet meer waar ik eerder voor stond
Zandlopertjes keer ik weer om
Zo is mijn wereld cirkel rond
Ik oogst wat ik zaai
En ik ontwikkel wat ik draai
Pure vreugde zwak verschaf
Kom met me dansen op me graf

En ik oogst en ik zaai
En ik ontwikkel en ik draai
Pure vreugde zwak verschaf
Kom met me dansen op me graf
Ik ben gekomen naar man en macht
Maar breng het wel met een nonchalance
Van een kind die zondags met een bal tegen de garage aan trapt
Ik bouw bruggen
Loop erover heen en krijg een kogel met mijn naam op
En een onderschrift
Blijf daar waar hier iets voorsteld
Ik hoor je wel
Maar stel je voor dat ik aan die eis voldoe
Dan blijven we allemaal eilandbewoners
Zie wat een man met zijn rijms kan doen
Ik heb wat schuld maar met gaat het goed
Typhoon van de Fakkel tijd roem
Oke leven weet je
Verspreid tussen ruimte tijd genoeg

En ik oogst en ik zaai
En ik ontwikkel en ik draai
Pure vreugde zwak verschaf
Kom met me dansen op me graf
En ik oogst en ik zaai
En ik ontwikkel en ik draai
Pure vreugde zwak verschaf
Kom met me dansen op me graf
En ik oogst en ik zaai
En ik ontwikkel en ik draai
Pure vreugde zwak verschaf
Kom met me dansen op me graf
En ik oogst en ik zaai
En ik ontwikkel wat ik draai
Pure vreugde zwak verschaf

Op me graf

Guardare più lontano e perdersi in se stessi
La luce che rinasce e coglierne i riflessi
Su pianure azzurre si aprono
Su più su i miei pensieri spaziano
Ed io mi accorgo che
Che tutto intorno a me, a me

Musica è
La danza regolare di tutti i tuoi respiri su di me
La festa dei tuoi occhi appena mi sorridi
Tu e il suono delle labbra tue
Tu sempre di più
Quell'armonia raggiunta in due
Ti ascolterò perché
Sei musica per me, per me
Musica è...
Musica è...
Musica è...
Musica è...
Musica è...
Musica è...
Musica è...
Musica è...

Io sento ancora
Le voci della strada dove son nato
Mia madre quante volte mi avrà chiamato
Ma era più forte il grido di libertà
E sotto il sole
Che fulmina i cortili
Le corse polverose dei bambini
Che di giocare non la smettono più

Io sento ancora cantare in dialetto
Le ninne nanne di pioggia sul tetto
Tutto questo è per me
Questo dolce arpeggiare
È musica da ricordare
È dentro di me...
Fa parte di me...
Cammina con me

È
Musica è
L'amico che ti parla
Quando ti senti solo
Sai che una mano puoi trovarla

È
Musica è
Da conservare, da salvare insieme a te
Senti
Più siamo in tanti e più in alto sale
Un coro in lingua universale
Dice che dice che
Anche del cielo han bucato la pelle
Lo senti

È l'urlo delle stelle
Forse cambierà
Nella testa della gente
La mentalità
Di chi ascolta ma non sente
Prima che il silenzio
Scenda su ogni cosa
Quel silenzio grande
Dopo l'aria esplosa
Perché un mondo senza musica
Non si può neanche immaginare
Perché ogni cuore anche il più piccolo

È un battito di vita e d'amore
Che musica è
Musica è
Musica..."

And the fireworks are through
Here we are, me and you
Feeling lost and feeling blue

It's the end of the party
And the morning seems so grey
So unlike yesterday
Now's the time for us to say

Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend

Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't, we might as well lay down and die
For you and I

Sometimes I see
How the brave new world arrives
And I see how it thrives
In the ashes of our lives

Oh yes, man is a fool
And he thinks he'll be okay
Dragging on, feet of clay
Never knowing he's astray
Keeps on going anyway

Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend

Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't, we might as well lay down and die
For you and I

Seems to me now
That the dreams we had before
Are all dead, nothing more
Than confetti on the floor

It's the end of a decade
In another ten years' time
Who can say what we'll find
What lies waiting down the line
In the end of eighty-nine?

Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend

Some time when it always seemed to be just us and them
Girls that wore pink and boys that wore blue
Boys that always grew up better men than me and you

What's a man now, what's a man mean
Is he rough or is he rugged
Is he cultural and clean
Now it's all changed, it's got to change more
'Cause we think it's getting better
But nobody's really sure

And so it goes, go 'round again
But now and then we wonder who the real men are

Whoa, hoh...

See the nice boys, dancing in pairs
Golden earring, golden tan, blow wave in their hair
Sure, they're all straight, straight as a line
All the gays are macho
Can't you see the leather shine

You don't want to sound dumb, don't want to offend
So don't call me a faggot
Not unless you are a friend
Then if you're tall and handsome and strong
You can wear the uniform and I could play along

And so it goes, go 'round again
But now and then we wonder who the real men are

Whoa, hoh...

Time to get scared, time to change plan
Don't know how to treat a lady
Don't know how to be a man
Time to admit what you call defeat
'Cause there's women running past you now
And you just drag your feet

Man makes a gun, man goes to war
Man can kill and man can drink
And man can take a whore
Kill all the blacks, kill all the reds
And if there's war between the sexes
Then there'll be no people left

And so it goes, go 'round again
But now and then we wonder who the real men are

November en nat
Vlakbij de vijver zit een man,
Herman
En Herman is het zat
Heeft een kutjaar gehad

Een man met alles
Wat je hebben kan
Vrouw, kind, huis, auto, baan
Zo'n baan
Maar Herman wilde het ooit anders
En denkt daar nu al maanden aan

Hij denkt aan wat ie wou
En denkt ik was te laf
Hij denkt is dit het nou?
Herman denkt zichzelf in het graf

Was het niet gisteren
Dat ik aankwam hier
Pas achttien jaar jong?
Zou ik niet feesten, zuipen, reizen?
Zou ik niet doen wat ik ooit zong?

Maar reizen kan niet meer
Dat had ie mooi gedacht
Ja, reizen terug naar huis
Want er wordt met het eten gewacht

Als het vuur gedoofd is
Dan komen de wolven

Vrijdagmiddag in het Vondelpark
En Herman staat op
Hij zwaait zijn tas ver de vijver in
En zingt weer hardop
Allang geen achttien meer
En het heldendom voorbij
Maar als ik nu niet ga
Dan is voorgoed een droom voorbij

Hen die ik pijn doe
Vergeef me mijn gemis
Maar alles gaat verkeerd
En weet je wat het is?

Als het vuur gedoofd is
Dan komen de wolven

Dinsdagochtend op een grindpad
Het weekend geweest
Men maakt zich op
Voor de wandeling
Als ging men naar een feest

En Herman mag voorop
Heeft het als enige niet koud
Want hij gaat strak gekleed
In een kist van gevoerd vurenhout

Als het vuur gedoofd is
Dan komen de wolven"

Robbing me of my rightful chances

One of us had to go
Now it's different, I want you to know

One of us is crying, one of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead

One of us is lonely, one of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself
As a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away
From the heat and the action

Just like a child
Stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show
One of us had to go
Now I've changed and I want you to know

One of us is crying, one of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead

Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small

On either side of the political fence
We share the same biology
Regardless of ideology

There is no historical precedent
To put the words in the mouth of the president
There's no such thing as a winnable war

Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?

When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I"

906,907,Sound And Vision,David Bowie,1977,"Don't you wonder sometimes
About sound and vision?

Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue
Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do, nothing to say
Blue, blue
I will sit right down
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude
Over my head

Don't you wonder sometimes
About sound and vision?"
907,908,1979,Smashing Pumpkins,1996,"Shakedown 1979
Cool kids never have the time
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet

Junebug skipping like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end
To it all

And I don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust, I guess
Forgotten and absorbed to the earth below

Double cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store
Morphine city slippin' dues
Down to see

That we don't even care, as restless as we are
We feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement
Lamented and assured to the lights

And towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope

Justine never knew the rules
Hung down with the freaks and ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it to see

That we don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust, I guess
Forgotten and absorbed to the earth below

The street heats the urgency of now
As you see, there's no one around"

En zoveel schoonheid heb ik nooit verdiend
Daar staat ze
En zoveel gratie heb ik nooit gezien

Soms praat ze
Terwijl ze slapend met m'n kussen speelt
Ik laat ze
Zolang ze maar met mij m'n lakens deelt

En zelfs de hoeders van de wet
Kijken minzaam als ze fout parkeert
En zelfs de flikken hebben pret
Als ze sensueel voorbij marcheert
Ongegeneerd

Ik weet wel
Dat zij waarschijnlijk niet lang bij me blijft
Ik weet wel
Dat zij met anderen haar tijd verdrijft

Zij heeft soms
Geheimen waar ik liever niets van weet
Zij zweeft soms
En droomt zodat ze soms ook mij vergeet

En zelfs de hoeders van de kerk
Kijken minzaam op haar schoonheid neer
De bisschop zegt: ""Dit is Gods werk""
Buigt z'n grijze hoofd en dankt de Heer
Nog eens een keer
Dank u, meneer

Zij heeft soms
Geheimen waar ik liever niets van weet
Zij zweeft soms
En droomt zodat ze soms ook mij vergeet

En zelfs de hoeders van dit land
Zouden liever in m'n schoenen staan
Ja, de premier dingt naar haar hand
En biedt mij zijn portefeuille aan
Maar ik denk er niet aan
Loop naar de maan

Daar gaat ze
Daar gaat ze"

Why should you care if you're feeling good?
Take the long way home
Take the long way home

But there are times that you feel you're part of the scenery
All the greenery is comin' down, boy
And then your wife seems to think you're part of the furniture
Oh, it's peculiar, she used to be so nice

When lonely days turn to lonely nights
You take a trip to the city lights
And take the long way home
Take the long way home

You never see what you want to see
Forever playing to the gallery
You take the long way home
Take the long way home

And when you're up on the stage, it's so unbelievable
Oh, unforgettable, how they adore you
But then your wife seems to think you're losing your sanity
Oh, calamity, is there no way out?
Oh, yeah

Ooh

Ooh, yeah

Does it feel that your life's become a catastrophe?
Oh, it has to be for you to grow, boy
When you look through the years and see what you could have been
Oh, what you might have been if you'd have had more time

So when the day comes to settle down
Who's to blame if you're not around?
You took the long way home
You took the long way home
You took the long way home (Ooh, yeah, yeah)
You took the long way home
You took the long way home (Oh, yeah)
You took the long way home

There'll be no value in the strength of walls that I have grown
There'll be no comfort in the shade of the shadows thrown
But I'll be yours if you'll be mine

Stretch out my life and pick the seams out
Take what you like, but close my ears and eyes
Watch me stumble over and over

I have done wrong, so build your tower
But call me home and I will build a throne
And wash my eyes out never again

But love the one you hold
And I'll be your gold
To have and to hold
A lover of the light

Skin too tight and eyes like marbles
You spin me high so watch me as I glide
Before I tumble homeward, homeward

I know I tried, I was not stable
Flawed by pride, I miss my sanguine eyes
So hold my hands up... breathe in, breathe out.

But love the one you hold
And I'll be your gold
To have and to hold
A lover of the light

And in the middle of the night, I may watch you go
There'll be no value in the strength of walls that I have grown
There'll be no comfort in the shade of the shadows thrown
You may not trust the promises of the change I'll show
But I'll be yours if you'll be mine

Walk away just a little bit slower
Better hold on tight, will we ever learn to let it go
Break through to the other side
I keep wondering
When were you ever gonna let me know
That you just wanted something else in life

What do you say when it's all over
What do you know when nothing's going right
The troubles in your mind
What do you do when you get lost inside your soul
Where do you go when love's gone
What do you say nothing at all

It was so hard when I watched you falling down
But it was time for you to walk alone
Just know if you really need a friend
And you're feeling like you can't go on

Just walk back just a little bit faster
Take my hand I will blow your fears away
Break through to the other side
For bitter or worse I know you better than anyone else
And I'll be by your side

What do you say when it's all over
What do you do when it's all gone
What do you do when you get lost inside your soul
Where do we go when love's gone
What do you say nothing at all

When it all becomes reality
That this is where it ends for you and me
I'm about to lose my mind
Will love find a way on time
Please don't try and kiss these tears away
We know we've both have made mistakes
If I could do it all again
I wouldn't change a single thing

What do you say when it's all over
What do you do when it's all gone
What do you do when you get lost inside your soul

What do you say nothing at all

Je bent ineens geen kind meer
Maar zo mooi en minstens zeventien

Oeh, belle Helene
Helene, ma belle
Oeh, belle Helene
Helene, ma belle

Ik weet niet of het goed of slecht is
Dat ik met je vrijen wou

927,928,Suzanne,Herman Van Veen,1969,"Suzanne neemt je mee naar een bank aan het water
Duizend schepen gaan voorbij en toch wordt het maar niet later
En je weet dat ze te gek is, want daarom zit je naast haar
En ze geeft je pepermuntjes, want ze geeft je graag iets tastbaars
En net als je haar wilt zeggen, ik kan jou geen liefde geven
Komt heel de stad tot leven en hoor je meeuwen schreeuwen
Je hebt steeds van haar gehouden

En je wilt wel met haar mee gaan, samen naar de overkant
Je moet haar wel vertrouwen, want ze houdt al jou gedachten in haar hand

En Jezus was een visser die het water zo vertrouwde
dat hij zomaar over zee lief omdat hij had leren houden
van de golven en de branding waarin niemand kan verdrinken
Hij zei: Als men blijft geloven kan de zwaarste steen niet zinken
Maar de wereld ging pas open toen zijn lichaam was gebroken
Hoe hij heeft geleden weet alleen die visser aan het kruis

En je wilt wel met hem mee gaan, samen naar de overkant
Je moet hem wel vertrouwen, want hij houdt al jou gedachten in zijn hand

Suzanne neemt je mee naar een bank aan het water
Je onthoudt waar ze naar kijkt als herinnering voor later
Zonlicht lijkt wel honing waar aan kinderen zich te goed doen
En het grasveld ligt bezaaid met wat de mensen allemaal weg doen
In de goot liggen de helden met een glimlach op de lippen
En de meeuwen in de lucht lijken net verdwaalde stippen
Als Suzanne je lachend aankijkt

En je wilt wel met haar mee gaan, samen naar de overkant
Je moet haar wel vertrouwen, want ze houdt al jou gedachten in haar hand"

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me

I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely

It seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm, she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

Built like she was, she had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here, I put her on the back of my bike
And we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm

I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something 'bout the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't too bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm, she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star

Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell ya, if I had the chance to do it all again, ooh
I wouldn't change a stroke
'Cause, baby, I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then, Lord

(The kind you find) The kind you find
(In a second hand store) The kind you find, oh no no
(Raspberry beret) Ahha, ah ha

That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man

Just to get it all out, what's in my head

Y'all act like you've never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (ahh!)

It's the return of the... ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha, ha!)

Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who."" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""

Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms (Uhh-uhh-uhh!)
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose but can't
But it's cool for <span class=""plainlinks"">Tom Green</span> to hump a dead moose

""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is

Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is by the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothing but mammals... well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes

But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope (eugh!)
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose; sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Cause Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you, too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half o' you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me

""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys can just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to <span class=""plainlinks"">Britney Spears</span>?
Yo shit, <span class=""plainlinks"">Christina Aguilera</span> better switch me chairs

So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hehe""

I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (ahh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups; all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you

And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk, and act like me
And just might be the next best thing but not quite me

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up

I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends, inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugar-coat it all

I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (rip), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums

It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurses asses, while I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And I'm jerkin', but this whole bag of Viagra isn't workin'

In every single person there's a Slim Shady lurkin'
Who could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot circling, screamin' ""I don't give a fuck""
With his windows down and his system up

So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar

I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die

And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando

Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?

I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando

Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret

Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high

Though my eyes could see, I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think, I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say

Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know

On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about, I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say

Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
No!

Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, none can equal the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
Surely heaven waits for you

Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest

Tenminste dat had ze gedacht.
Maar ik heb in mijn hoofd nog wat zonlicht bewaard,

Met zonder jas stap ik naar buiten.
Begin ik mijn tocht vol goeie moed.
Ik moet me inhouden niet te gaan fluiten.
Zo loop ik de zon tegemoet.

Vandaag zie ik m'n vrienden van vroeger.
Gewoon om te zien of er ergens iets zit.
Van die jongens in ons die nergens om vroegen.
Die niet wilde weten wat zwart was of wit.

Ik heb tranen gelachen onnozel gedaan,
En tenslotte tevreden.. het licht uitgedaan.

Ik word begroet met een klap op m'n schouder.
Hoe is het met jou eerst grap eerste glas.
Hier in dit licht zijn we nauwelijks ouder.
Even een stilte dan lachen we pas.

Eén voor één druppelt het binnen.
De mannen van toen veranderen nooit.
Maar toch is er nog zoveel nieuws te verzinnen.
De mannen van toen veranderen nooit.

Ik heb tranen gelachen onnozel gedaan,
En tenslotte tevreden.. het licht uitgedaan.

De sterren voorspellen een ochtend in maart die fluistert de Lente begint
En ik kan hier op dit uur geen taxi meer krijgen.
Maar dat maakt me niet uit, de Lente begint.

Ik heb tranen gelachen onnozel gedaan
En tenslotte tevreden.. het licht uitgedaan.

968,969,Question,Moody Blues,1970,"Why do we never get an answer

About hate and death and war?

'Cause when we stop and look around us
There is nothing that we need
In a world of persecution

Why do we never get an answer
When we're knocking at the door?
Because the truth is hard to swallow
That's what the war of love is for

When you do those things to me
It's more the way that you mean it
When you tell me what will be

And when you stop and think about it
You won't believe it's true
That all the love you've been giving
Has all been meant for you

I'm looking for someone to change my life
I'm looking for a miracle in my life
And if you could see 
What it's done to me
To lose the the love I knew
Could safely lead me through

Between the silence of the mountains
And the crashing of the sea
There lies a land I once lived in
And she's waiting there for me

But in the grey of the morning
My mind becomes confused
Between the dead and the sleeping
And the road that I must choose

I'm looking for someone to change my life
I'm looking for a miracle in my life
And if you could see 
What it's done to me
To lose the love I knew
Could safely lead me to
The land that I once knew
To learn as we grow old
The secrets of our souls

And let you see a side of me
That wants you here and cries real tears
And needs someone to love
I'm not so tough

I know that you've been hurt before
Well so have I what can you do
That doesn't mean you close the door

Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

""Pride will tear us both apart""
Well, now, pride's gone out the window 'cross the rooftops, run away

Where is my friend when I need you most?

Fear today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here beside the news of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk

Tell me how you feel.
Tell me what you need,
Just tell me how you feel.

Rain down on me

1001,1002,Too Much Love Will Kill You,Brian May,1992,"I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I'm far away from home
And I've been facing this alone for much too long
I feel like no one ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In my tangled state of mind
I've been looking back to find where I went wrong

Too much love will kill you
If you can't make up your mind
Torn between the lover and the love you leave behind
You're headed for disaster 'cause you never read the signs
Too much love will kill you - every time

I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
I used to bring you sunshine
Now all I ever do is bring you down
How would it be if you were standing in my shoes?
Can't you see that it's impossible to choose?
No there's no making sense of it
Every way I go I have to lose

Too much love will kill you
Just as sure as none at all
It'll drain the power that's in you
Make sure you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy
You're the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you - every time

Too much love will kill you
It'll make your life a lie
Yes, Too much love will kill you
And you won't understand why
You'd give your life you'd sell your soul
But here it comes again
Too much love will kill you
In the end...
In the end"
1002,1003,Miss You,Rolling Stones,1978,"I've been holding out so long
I've been sleeping all alone
Lord, I miss you
I've been hanging on the phone
I've been sleeping all alone
I wanna kiss you, sometime

Well, I've been haunted in my sleep
You've been starring in my dreams
Lord, I miss you child
I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
Your phone rings

It's just a friend of mine that say
""Hey, what's the matter, man?
We're gonna come around at twelve
With some Puerto Rican girls that's just dying to meet you
We're gonna bring a case of wine
Hey, let's go mess and fool around
You know, like we used to""

Ooh baby why you wait so long
Ooh baby why you wait so long
Won't you come home, come home

I've been walking Central Park
Singing after dark
People think I'm crazy
Stuffling on my feet
Shuffling through the street
Asking people, ""What's the matter with you, boy?""
Sometime I wanna say to, to myself
Sometimes I say

Hoo hoo-ho-hoo
Hoo hoo-ho-hoo
Hoo ho-hoo yeah
Hoo hoo-ho-hoo
Hoo hoo-ho-hoo
I miss you child

I guess I'm lying to myself
It's just you and no one else
Lord, I wanna kiss you child
You just been plucking out my mind
Fooling on my time
Lord, I wanna kiss you baby, yeah
Lord, I miss you child
Oooh hoo aaahh

Lord, I miss you child
Lord, I miss you child"

1004,1005,Ziggy Stardust,David Bowie,1972,"Oh
Oh, yeah

Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band

Ziggy really sang
Screwed-up eyes and screwed-down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
They came on so loaded, man
Well-hung and snow-white tan

So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh

Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was the nazz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But, boy, could he play guitar

Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind, ah
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band

Oh, yeah
Ooh

Ziggy played guitar"
1005,1006,No More Tears,Ozzy Osbourne,1990,"The light in the window is a crack in the sky
A stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye
A levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back
The man in the dark will bring another attack

Your mama told you that you're
Not supposed to talk to strangers
Look in the mirror, tell me
Do you think your life's in danger, yeah

No more tears 
No more tears
No more tears
No more tears

Another day passes as the night closes in
The red light goes on to say it's time to begin

I see the man around the corner waiting
Can he see me?
I close my eyes and wait to hear
The sound of someone screaming here

No more tears
No more tears
No more tears
No more tears

It's just a sign of the times
Going forward in reverse
Still
He who laughs last
Is just a hand in the bush

So now that it's over can we just say goodbye?
(I'd like, I'd like)
I'd like to move on and make the most of the night
Maybe a kiss before I leave you this way
Your lips are so cold I don't know what else to say

I never wanted it to end this way
My love, my darling
Believe me when I say to you
In love I think I'm falling here

No more tears
No more tears
No more tears
No more tears

Is just a hand in the bush..."

1007,1008,Het Werd Zomer,Rob de Nijs,1977,"Het leek al zomer, toch was het pas eind mei.
Zo'n dag waarvan je denkt, die gaat niet meer voorbij.
M'n vrienden kwamen langs, maar ik wilde alleen
aan het strand wat wandelen,
zomaar nergens heen.

Toen zag ik jouw
Je riep me met je ogen,
Ik keek je aan, en kreeg een vreemd gevoel.
Want ik begreep wat jij me wilde vragen,
kom dichterbij me.

Ik was zestien, en jij was achtentwintig.
En van de liefde wist ik nog niet veel,
maar ik begreep wat jij me wilde zeggen
Ik was geen kind meer;
En het werd zomer

Je was zo vrij, ik vond het eerst een beetje raar.
Je droeg niet anders dan je lange blonde haar.
Ik was verlegen, en wist niet wat te doen
ik stond daar maar te kijken,
oh wat voelde ik me groen

Ik begrijp het, hoorde ik je zeggen
Je bent zo jong nog, en weet niet wat je moet
wees maar niet bang, de nacht zal het je leren
kom dichterbij me

we liepen samen
verder langs het strand
en als een jongen pakte ik je hand
maar als een man zag ik de zon weer opgaan
en het werd zomer (2x)

Het werd zomer
voor het eerst in heel m'n leven
Het werd zomer
De allereerste keer
en ik was een man toen de zon weer opkwam
en het werd zomer

Toen was het zomer"
1008,1009,Speeltuin,Marco Borsato,1998,"Door kapot geschoten straten
Zonder vader, zonder land
Loop je hulpeloos verlaten
Aan je moeders warme hand

Als een schaap tussen de wolven
Naar bestemming ""onbekend""
En niemand ziet hoe klein je bent
Niemand ziet hoe klein je bent (2x)

Morgen zal het vrede zijn
Zal de zon je strelen
Zal de wereld weer een speeltuin zijn
En kun je rustig spelen

Na de winter komt de lente
Wordt de grijze lucht weer blauw
Maar al ben je uit de oorlog
Gaat de oorlog ooit uit jou?
Mooie ogen zijn vergiftigd
Zijn aan het geweld gewend
En niemand ziet hoe klein je bent
Niemand ziet hoe klein je bent (2x)"

ik ben altijd maar de coole
ik doe alles voor mijn kick
ik ben altijd maar de macho

Honey, the road'll even end in Kathmandu.
You can go all around the world
Trying to find something to do with your life, baby,
When you only gotta do one thing well,
You only gotta do one thing well to make it in this world, babe.
You got a woman waiting for you there,
All you ever gotta do is be a good man one time to one woman

Memory, All alone in the moonlight
I can dream of the old days
Life was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every streetlamp seems to beat
A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon
It will be morning

Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in.
When the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
A streetlamp dies; another night is over
Another day is dawning...

All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun...
If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day has begun."

Once it sets its eyes on you

Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside

You gotta be on somebody's books
The lowdown - a picture of your face
Your injured looks
The sacred and profane
The pleasure and the pain
Somewhere your fingerprints remain concrete
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street

A ladykiller - regulation tattoo
Silver spurs on his heels
Says - what can I tell you, as I'm standing next to you
She threw herself under my wheels
Oh it's a dangerous road
And a hazardous load
And the fireworks over liberty explode in the heat
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street

A three-chord symphony crashes into space
The moon is hanging upside down
I don't know why it is I'm still on the case
It's a ravenous town
And you still refuse to be traced
Seems to me such a waste
And every victory has a taste that's bittersweet
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street"

Mother will never understand why you had to leave
But the answers you seek will never be found at home
The love that you need will never be found at home

Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away

Pushed around and kicked around, always a lonely boy
You were the one that they'd talk about around town as they put you down

No, you never cried to them, just to your soul

Ik denk aan hoe je lacht
Ik denk aan al die liefde
Die jij aan me hebt gegeven
En wat jij verwacht
Aan wat je van me denkt
En hoe je voor me leeft
Ik ontwijk je ogen
Als ze mij willen doorgronden
Telkens als ze naar me kijken
Zorg ik dat ik ze net mis
Als je voor me staat
Vlucht ik steeds weer in je armen
Zodat ik niet kan verraden
Wat de waarheid is
Elke dag vertel je mij
Hoeveel je van me houdt
Hoe fijn je leeft in zekerheid
Hoe jij op mij vertrouwt

Hoe vertel je iemand
Dat de aarde niet meer rond is
Dat de vogels niet meer vliegen
En de zon niet langer schijnt
Hoe vertel ik jou
Dat 't leven dat je leefde
En de liefde die je voelde
Binnenkort verdwijnt
Je raakt me kwijt

Je raakt me kwijt
'T Is de waarheid

Hoe vertel je iemand
Dat de aarde niet meer rond is

Only a phone call away
You tried to track him down but somebody stole his number
As a matter of fact
You're getting used to life without him in your way

So if I can shoot rabbits then I can shoot fascists
Bullets for your brain today, but we'll forget it all again
Monuments put from pen to paper turns me into a gutless wonder

And if you tolerate this then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this then your children will be next, will be next, will be next, will be next

Gravity keeps my head down, or is it maybe shame?
At being so young and being so vain
Holes in your head today, but I'm a pacifist
I've walked Las Ramblas but not with real intent

And if you tolerate this then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this then your children will be next, will be next, will be next, will be next
Will be next

And on the street tonight an old man plays with newspaper cuttings of his glory days

And if you tolerate this then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this then your children will be next, will be next, will be next, will be next"

Woke up from where she was lyin' still
Said I gotta do something
About where we're goin'

Step on a steam train
Step out of the driving rain, maybe
Run from the darkness in the night
Singing ah, ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day

Sweet the sin, bitter the taste in my mouth
I see seven towers, but I only see one way out
You gotta cry without weeping, talk without speaking
Scream without raising your voice
You know I took the poison, from the poison stream
Then I floated out of here, singing
Ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day

She walks through the streets
With her eyes painted red
Under black belly of cloud in the rain
In through a doorway
She brings me white golden pearls
Stolen from the sea

She is ragin'
She is ragin'
And the storm blows up in her eyes
She will suffer the needle chill
She's running to stand still"

Would you even care?

How they rape the universe
How they've gone from bad to worse

Dancing in the sand

Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back, she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad

Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the song
The words she knows, the tune she hums

But, oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Can make you feel so small

And you've taken all you can bear

But you know you could never make me love you more

Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
And it all just sound like, ""Oooh.""

Hmmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing, but she's dancing with another man

My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like, ""Oooh.""

Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
Should've gave all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing, but she's dancing with another man

Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hands
Give you all his hours when he has the chance
Take you to every party 'cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should've done when I was your man
Do all the things I should've done when I was your man"

Strength and beauty destined to decay
So cut the rose in full bloom

'Til the fearless come and the act is done
A love like blood, a love like blood
'Til the fearless come and the act is done
A love like blood, a love like blood

Every day, through all frustration and despair
Love and hate fight with burning hearts
'Til legends live and man is god again
And self-preservation rules the day no more
We must dream of promised lands and fields
That never fade in season
As we move towards no end, we learn to die
Red tears are shed on grey

'Til the fearless come and the act is done
A love like blood, a love like blood
'Til the fearless come and the act is done
A love like blood, a love like blood

'Til the fearless come and the act is done
A love like blood, a love like blood

A love like blood, a love like blood"
1036,1037,A Gentleman's Excuse Me,Fish,1990,"(Instrumental 25 secs)

Do you still keep paper flowers
In the bottom drawer with your Belgian lace
Taking them out every year
To watch the colours fade away

Do you still believe in fairy tales
In battlements of shining castles
Safe from the dragons
That lie beneath the hill

Are you still a Russian princess
Rescued by a Gypsy dancer
To anyone who'll listen
Is that a story you still tell

You live a life of fantasy
Your diary romantic fiction
Can't you see it's hard for me
Can you see what I'm trying to say

It's a gentleman's excuse me
So I'll take one step to the side
Can you get it inside your head
I'm tired of dancing

For every one step forward
I'm taking two steps back
Can you get it inside your head
I'm tired of dancing

(Instrumental 21 secs)

I know you still like old-fashioned waltzes
Your reflection in the mirror that you flirt with
As you glide across the floor
But if I told you the music's over
Would you want to hear
That your dance card is empty
That there's no one really there

Do you still believe in Santa Claus
There's a millionaire looking for your front door
With a key to a life
That you'd never understand

And all I have to offer
Is the love I have it's freely given
You'll see its value
When you see what I tried to say

It's a gentleman's excuse me
So I'll do one step to the side
Can you get it inside your head
I'm tired of dancing

For every one step forward
I'm taking two steps back
Can you get it inside your head
That from this one step forward
There's no turning back
Can you get in inside your head
I'm tired of dancing

We're finished dancing"

May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart

You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in

And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend never will

Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch, we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child

And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years

And it seems to me you've lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in

And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend never will

Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed yourselves
Where lives were torn apart

Goodbye England's rose
From a country lost without your soul
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion
More than you will ever know

And it seems to me you've lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in

And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will"

Speelt het blikken harmonie-orkest in een grote regenton
Daar trekt over de heuvels en door het grote bos
De lange stoete de bergen in van het circus Jeroen Bosch
En we praten en we zingen en we lachen allemaal
Want daar achter de hoge bergen ligt het land van Maas en Waal.

Ik loop gearmd met een kater voorop
daarachter twee konijnen met een trechter op hun kop
en dan de grote snoeshaan die legt een glazen ei
wanneer je 't schudt dan sneeuwt het op de Egmondse abdij.

Ik reik een meisje mijn koperen hand
Dan komen er 2 Moren met hun slepen in de hand
Dan blaast er de fanfare ter ere van de schaar
Die trouwt met de vingerhoed, ze houden van elkaar.

Onder de purperen hemel, in de bruine zon
Speelt nog steeds het harmonie-orkest in een grote regenton
Daar trekt over de heuvels en door het grote bos
De lange stoete de bergen in van het circus Jeroen Bosch
En we praten en we zingen en we lachen allemaal
Want daar achter de hoge bergen ligt het land van Maas en Waal.

We zijn aan de koning van Spanje ontsnapt
Die had ons in zijn bed en de provisiekast betrapt
We staken alle kerken met brandewijn in brand
't Is koud vuur, dus het geeft niet
en het komt niet in de krant

Het leed is geleden, de horizon schijnt
Wanneer de doden dronken zijn en pierlala verdwijnt
Dan steken we de loftrompet en ook de dikke draak
En eten 's avonds zandgebak op het feestje bij Klaas Vaak.

Onder de gouden hemel, in de zilveren zon
Speelt altijd het harmonie-orkest in een grote regenton
Daar trekt over de heuvels en door het grote bos
De stoet voorgoed de bergen in van het circus Jeroen Bosch

And on your own
Bedshaped
And legs of stone
You'll knock on my door
And up we'll go
In white light

But what do I know?
What do I know?
I know

Oh, and up we'll go
In white light

1047,1048,If I Were A Boy,Beyoncé,2008,"If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go

Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off the phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone

I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home
To come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh, ooh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (you wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (for granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand (yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday you'll wish you were a better man

You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything that you had got destroyed

But you're just a boy"
1048,1049,The Eve Of The War,Jeff Wayne,1978,"Journalist: No one would have believed, in the last years of the 19th century, that human affairs were being watched from the timeless worlds of space. No one could have dreamed we were being scrutinized, as someone with a microscope studies creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. Few men even considered the possibility of life on other planets and yet, across the gulf of space, minds immeasurably superior to ours regarded this Earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely, they drew their plans against us.

At midnight on the 12th of August, a huge mass of luminous gas erupted from Mars and sped towards Earth. Across 200 million miles of void, invisibly hurtling towards us came the first of the missiles that were to bring so much calamity to Earth. As I watched, there was another jet of gas. It was another missile, starting on its way.

And that's how it was for the next ten nights. A flare, spurting out from Mars, bright green, drawing a green mist behind it. A beautiful, but somehow disturbing sight. Ogilvy assured me we were in no danger. He was convinced there could be no living thing on that remote, forbidding planet.

""The chances of anything coming from mars are a million to one"" he said
""The chances of anything coming from mars are a million to one, but still they come!""

Journalist: Then came the night the first missile approached Earth. It was thought to be an ordinary falling star, but the next day there was a huge crater in the middle of the Common, and Ogilvy came to examine what lay there: a cylinder, 30 yards across, glowing hot...and with faint sounds of movement coming from within. Suddenly the top began moving, rotating, unscrewing, and Ogilvy feared there was a man inside, trying to escape. He rushed to the cylinder, but the intense heat stopped him before he could burn himself on the metal.

""The chances of anything coming from mars are a million to one"" he said
""The chances of anything coming from mars are a million to one, but still they come!""
""Yes the chances of anything coming from mars are a million to one"" he said
""The chances of anything coming from mars are a million to one, but still they come!""

Journalist: It seems totally incredible to me now that everyone spent that evening as though it were just like any other. From the railway station came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost into melody by the distance. It all seemed so safe and tranquil."

Had no luck at all
Nothing came easy to him

He'd made up his mind
'This could be my last chance'

Just another lonely boy in town
And she's out runnin' round

She wasn't just another woman
And I couldn't keep from comin' on
It's been so long
Oh and it's a hollow feelin'

Wonder why the right words never come

I've played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall

Sure plays a mean pinball

He stands like a statue
Becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean
Plays by intuition
The digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball

He's a pinball wizard
There has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's
Got such a supple wrist

How do you think he does it?
I don't know!
What makes him so good?

Ain't got no distractions
Can't hear no buzzers and bells
Don't see no lights are flashin'
Plays by sense of smell
Always gets a replay
Never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball

I thought I was
The Bally table king
But I just handed
My pinball crown to him

Even on my favorite table
He can beat my best
His disciples lead him in
And he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers
Never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball"

Tattooed on my arm is a charm to disarm all the harm
Gotta keep myself calm but the truth is you're gone
And I'll never get to show you these songs
Dad you should see the tours that I'm on
I see you standing there next to Mom
Both singing along, yeah arm in arm
And there are days when I'm losing my faith
Because the man wasn't good he was great
He'd say ""Music was the home for your pain""
And explained I was young, he would say
Take that rage, put it on a page
Take that page to the stage
Blow the roof off the place
I'm trying to make you proud
Do everything you did
I hope you're up there with God saying ""That's my kid!""

Would you pat me on the back or would you criticize me?
Would you follow every line on my tear-stained face

I know it's been a while but I can see you clear as day
Right now, I wish I could hear you say
I drink too much, and I smoke too much dutch

Love is a losing game
Five story fire as you came
Love is a losing game

One I wish I never played
Oh, what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand

Self professed profound
Till the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Though I battle blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned

Over futile odds
And laughed at by the Gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game"

They conspire with the sky, I'm sure it's me they're after.
Try to steel away my dreams, keep them for themselves.
As I'm stirring in my sleep, please just help me wake up.

Could fly over mountains
Could laugh at the ocean

To feel all the hard times
To lay down the hard lines

Nothing we can't shake

With nothing much at stake
As long as you're still smiling
There's nothing more I need

Sail over heartaches

Between the salt water and the sea strand

Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather

Yo, yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind

All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'

Leavin' with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it, imma expose it
I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD

I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't owe him a second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die

Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today

What I did was stupid, no doubt, it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd have killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen, 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen

Bitchin', that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Münchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick, when I wasn't
Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?

Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony

And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself, that you was a mom

But how dare you try to take when you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what: I am dead - dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry

Maybe they know we wiped their future away
Could be they've got nothing to say
Maybe they don't know whether they are going to stay, or not
I know they've got ONE thing to say

1089,1090,Sovereign Light Cafe,Keane,2012,"I'm going back to a time when we owned this town
Down Powdermill Lane and the battlegrounds
We were friends and lovers and clueless clowns
I didn't know I was finding out how I'd be torn from you
When we talked about things we were gonna do
We were wide-eyed dreamers and wiser too

We'd go down to the rides on East Parade
By the lights of the Palace Arcade
And watch night coming down
On the Sovereign Light Café

I'm begging you for some sign
But you've still got nothing to say
Don't turn your back on me, don't walk away
I'm a better man now than I was that day

Let's go down to the rides on East Parade
By the lights of the Palace Arcade
And watch night coming down
On the Sovereign Light Café
Let's go down to the bandstand on the pier
Watch the drunks and the lovers appear
To take turns as the stars
Of the Sovereign Light Café

I wheel my bike off the train
Up the North Trade Road
And look for you in Marley Lane
In every building, every street sign
Oh why did we ever go so far from home?

Well you've got nothing to hide
You can't change who you really are
You can get a big house and a faster car
You can run away boy, but you won't go far

Let's go down to the rides on East Parade
By the lights of the Palace Arcade
And watch night coming down
On the Sovereign Light Café
Let's go down to the bandstand on the pier
Watch the drunks and the lovers appear
To take turns as the stars

And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet

So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
How the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

Ooh yeah

I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still, the days seem the same

And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware what they're going through

Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time

Strange fascination fascinating me
Oh, changes are taking the pace I'm going through

Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Oh, look out you rock 'n' rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange

Pretty soon now, you're gonna get older
Time may change me

1091,1092,One Moment In Time,Whitney Houston,1988,"Each day I live, I want to be
A day to give the best of me
I'm only one, but not alone
My finest day is yet unknown

I broke my heart, for every gain
To taste the sweet, I face the pain
I rise and fall, yet through it all
This much remains

I want one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me

Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment all time
I will feel, I will feel eternity

I've lived to be the very best
I want it all, no time for less
I've laid the plans
Now lay the chance, here in my hands

Give me one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me

Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment all time
I will feel, I will feel, I will be free

Oh, you're a winner for a lifetime
If you seize that one moment in time, moment in time

Give me one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me

Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment all time
I will feel, I will feel, I will be free
Oh, I will feel, I will be free"
1092,1093,Top Of The World,Carpenters,1973,"Such a feeling's coming over me
There is wonder in most everything I see
Not a cloud in the sky
Got the sun in my eyes
And I won't be surprised if it's a dream

Everything I want the world to be
Is now coming true especially for me
And the reason is clear
It's because you are here
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen

I'm on the top of the world
Looking down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found
Ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world?

Something in the wind has learned my name
And it's telling me that things are not the same
In the leaves on the trees
And the touch of the breeze
There's a pleasing sense of happiness for me

There is only one wish on my mind
When this day is through I hope that I will find
That tomorrow will be
Just the same for you and me
All I need will be mine if you are here

I'm on the top of the world
Looking down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found
Ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world?

Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror

The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'm here tryin' to pull you through
You just gotta be strong

Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

Aren't you somethin', an original
Cause it doesn't seem really as sample
And I can't help but stare, cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time

I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go

Yesterday is history
Tomorrow's a mystery
I can see you lookin' back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me

Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold

You are, you are the love of my life

Baby, you're the inspiration of this precious song
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
And I can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you home
Just to let you know, you are

Girl you're my reflection, all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do
You're my reflection and all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do

You are, you are the love of my life"

Saturday, wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday, never hesitate

I don't care if Monday's black

Monday, you can hold your head
Tuesday, Wednesday, stay in bed
Or Thursday watch the walls instead
It's Friday I'm in love

Saturday, wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday, never hesitate

Dressed up to the eyes, it's a wonderful surprise
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throwing out your frown and just smiling at the sound
As sleek as a sheikh spinning 'round and 'round

Always take a big bite, it's such a gorgeous sight
To see you eat in the middle of the night
You can never get enough, enough of this stuff
It's Friday I'm in love, oh

1095,1096,Both Sides Now,Joni Mitchell,1968,"Bows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds, at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love, at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life, at all

I've looked at life from both sides now

When you dreamed them up

Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now, when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it

Clinging to not gettin' sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

There was somethin' missin'
You should have known by the tone of my voice, maybe
But you didn't listen

You played dead
Ah, but you never bled
Instead you lay still in the grass
All coiled up and hissin'

And though I know all about those men
Still I don't remember
'Cause it was us, baby, way before then
And we're still together

And I meant
Every word I said
When I said that I love you, I meant
That I'd love you forever

And I'm gonna keep on loving you
'Cause it's the only thing I want to do
I don't want to sleep
I just want to keep on loving you

And I meant
Every word I said
When I said that I love you, I meant
That I'd love you forever

And I'm gonna keep on loving you

Every time I think about it, I wanna cry
With bombs and the Devil and the kids keep coming
No way to breathe easy, no time to be young

But I tell myself that I was doing all right
There's nothing left to do at night

But go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh

My love is the evening breeze touching your skin
The gentle, sweet singing of leaves in the wind
The whisper that calls after you in the night
And kisses your ear in the early moonlight

And you don't need to wonder, you're doing fine
My love, the pleasure's mine

Let me go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh

Wild man's world is crying in pain
What you gonna do when everybody's insane?
So afraid of one who's so afraid of you
What you gonna do?

Ah
Ooh, crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

I was a willow last night in my dream
I bent down over a clear running stream
I sang you the song that I heard up above
And you kept me alive with your sweet flowing love

Crazy, yeah
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh

Crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, yeah

Ah
Crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh"

1111,1112,Storm And Thunder,Earth & Fire,1971,"Darkness of the night has gone
A blackbird sings a song at dawn
Crystal drops of morning dew
Are covering all the grass
The landscape wears its morning dress

The foliage of the wood shines bright
As green as emerald's light
Over the fields vibrating air
Causes a faintly glance
Some cows are grazing near a fence

While lowering clouds accumulate
Midges dancing above the lake
The haymakers, they go away
Hiding for a storm
A flash of lightening struck

Storm and thunder
Beat the nature
Down gushes the rain
And wind cracks the trees"

And I just can't get enough, and I just can't get enough
All the things you do to me and everything you said
I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough

We slip and slide as we fall in love
And I just can't seem to get enough

We walk together, we're walking down the street
And I just can't get enough, and I just can't get enough
Everytime I think of you I know we have to meet
And I just can't get enough, and I just can't get enough

It's getting hotter, it's a burning love
And I just can't seem to get enough

And when it rains you're shining down for me
And I just can't get enough, and I just can't get enough
Just like a rainbow, you know you set me free
And I just can't get enough, and I just can't get enough

You're like an angel and you give me your love

Hold me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand, come undercover
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Have I doubt when I'm alone
Love is a ring, the telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed until the morning comes

Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't touch you now
Can't touch you now
Can't touch you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

With love we sleep
With doubt the vicious circle turns and burns
Without you I cannot live
Forgive the yearning burning
I believe it's time, too real to feel
So touch me now
Touch me now
Touch me now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Because tonight there are two lovers
If we believe in the night we trust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

If we believe, tonight we're lovers
If we believe in the night we trust
Because the night belongs to lovers"

I can't stand the sound
Your pain is painful
And it's tearin' me down
I hear glasses breaking
As I sit up in my bed
I told dad you didn't mean
Those nasty things you said

You fight about money, 'bout me and my brother
And this I come home to, this is my shelter
It ain't easy growin' up in World War three
Never knowin' what love could be, you'll see
I don't want love to destroy me like it has done my family

Can we work it out?
Can we be a family?
I promise I'll be better
Mommy, I'll do anything
Can we work it out?
Can we be a family?

Daddy, please don't leave

Daddy, please stop yellin'
I can't stand the sound
Make mama stop cryin'
'Cause I need you around
My mama, she loves you
No matter what she says it's true
I know that she hurts you
But remember, I love you, too

I ran away today
Ran from the noise, ran away
Don't wanna go back to that place
But don't have no choice, no way
It ain't easy growin' up in World War three
Never knowin' what love could be, well, I've seen

Let's play pretend
Let's act like it comes naturally
I don't wanna have to split the holidays
I don't want two addresses
I don't want a step-brother anyways
And I don't want my mom to have to change her last name

In our family portrait
We look pretty happy
We look pretty normal

I'll be so much better
I'll do everything right
I'll be your little girl forever
I'll go to sleep at night"
1117,1118,In A Lifetime,Clannad & Bono,1986,"Hard to tell
Or recognise a sign
To see me through
A warning sign

(First the thunder)
Satisfied, if the past it will not lie
(Then the storm torn asunder)
The future you and I get blown away
(In the storm, in a lifetime)

And as the rain it falls, heavy in my heart
Begin again, as the storm breaks through
Believe the light in you
So the light shines in you

Without color, faded and worn
Torn asunder in the storm

Unless the sound has faded from your soul
Unless it disappears

(First the thunder, then the storm)
Selfish storm, hold on the inside
(Torn asunder in the storm)
One life in the storm

In a lifetime
In a lifetime

In a lifetime
In a lifetime"

All my dreams and all my balance

How long before you decide

If you never try, then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this mountain of mine

Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand
I'll start before I can stop
Or before I see things the right way up

All that noise and all that sound
All those places I got found

And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand

Ideas that you'll never find
All the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Or Japan and China all lit up
A sign that I couldn't read
Or a light that I could've seen
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me

All that noise and all that sound
All those places I got found

And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand
Oh, when you see it, then you'll understand

All those signs, I knew what they meant
Some things you can't invent
Some get made and some get sent, ooh

And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand

Don't you stand there like the rest
Without a heart you'll finish last
Without a heart you'll finish last

It's only words, and words are all I have
To take your heart away

It's only words, and words are all I have
To take your heart away

It's only words, and words are all I have
To take your heart away"
1126,1127,Behind Blue Eyes,Limp Bizkit,2004,"No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man
To be the sad man, behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it's like, to be hated
To be fated, to telling only lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance, that's never free

No one knows what it's like, to feel these feelings
Like I do, and I blame you (you, you, you)
No one bites back as hard, on their anger
None of my pain and woe, can show through (through, through, through)

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance, that's never free

Discover, L.I.M.P. say it 
Discover, L.I.M.P. say it
Discover, L.I.M.P. say it
Discover, L.I.M.P. say it
Discover

No one knows what it's like, to be mistreated
To be defeated, behind blue eyes (blue eyes, blue eyes, blue eyes)
And no one knows how to say, that they're sorry
And don't worry, I'm not telling lies (lies, lies)

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance, that's never free

No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man
To be the sad man, behind blue eyes"
1127,1128,Ruby Tuesday,Rolling Stones,1967,"She would never say where she came from
Yesterday don't matter if it's gone
While the sun is bright
Or in the darkest night
No one knows
She comes and goes

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

Don't question why she needs to be so free
She'll tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained
To a life where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost
At such a cost

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

""There's no time to lose,"" I heard her say
""Catch your dreams before they slip away""
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams
And you will lose your mind
Ain't life unkind?

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you"

Ik heb een masker opgezet
En als mijn vrienden erom vragen
Zeg ik dat het heerlijk is alleen
Je foto's zijn al van de wand
Alsof ik zo vergeten kan
Dat ik je mis
Hoe koud het is
Hoe leeg zo zonder jou
Hier om me heen

Ik kan je niet laten gaan
Al zeg ik dat het beter is
Alleen en zonder jou
Ik kan het gewoon niet aan
Ik mis je armen om me heen
Nee ik leef niet in een wereld zonder jou

Trijntje:
Ik heb bijna alles geprobeerd
Alles om je te vergeten
Ik lieg als ze me vragen hoe het gaat
Ik lees wat boeken kijk TV
Maar daar verandert ook niets mee
Ik voel nog steeds
Verlang nog steeds
Ik denk nog steeds
En steeds alleen aan jou 

Together:
Ik kan je niet laten gaan
Al zeg ik dat het beter is
Alleen en zonder jou
Ik kan het gewoon niet aan
Ik mis je armen om me heen
Nee ik leef niet in een wereld zonder jou 

De tijd staat stil
De tijd die alle wonden heelt
Ze loopt niet zonder jou
Ik kan je niet laten gaan
Al schreeuw ik dat het beter is
Alleen en zonder jou
Ik kan het gewoon niet aan
Ik mis je armen om me heen
En alles aan je waar ik zo van hou
waar ik zo van hou
Nee ik leef niet in een wereld
Zonder jou

1136,1137,Dear Mama,2Pac,1998,"You are appreciated

When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, scared to go home
I was a fool with the big boys, breakin all the rules
Shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies
The same drama, when things went wrong we blamed mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary
Hey, I'd see the penitentiary
One day, runnin from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand for a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare
Tell me how you did it? 
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand

You are appreciated

Lady, don't ya know we love ya (dear mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (you are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya

Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love for my daddy 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless
But all along I was lookin for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin
I needed money of my own so I started slangin
I ain't guilty 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin money in your mailbox
I love payin rent when the rent's due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to ya
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone because you cared for me
And I can see you comin home after work, late
You're in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
You're just workin with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin
But now the road got rough, you're alone
Tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand

You are appreciated

Lady, don't ya know we love ya (and dear mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (you are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy, there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are fulla all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be all right if you hold on
It's a struggle, everyday gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand

1141,1142,Cambodia,Kim Wilde,1981,"Well, he was Thailand based
She was an air force wife
He used to fly weekends
It was the easy life
But then it turned around
And he began to change
She didn't wonder then
She didn't think it strange
But then he got a call
He had to leave that night
He couldn't say too much
But it would be alright
He didn't need to pack
They'd meet the next night
He had a job to do
Flying to Cambodia

And as the nights passed by
She tried to trace the past
The way he used to look
The way he used to laugh
I guess she'll never know
What got inside his soul
She couldn't make it out
Just couldn't take it all
He had the saddest eyes
The girl had ever seen
He used to cry some nights
As though he lived a dream
And as she held him close
He used to search her face
Although she knew the truth
Lost inside Cambodia

But then a call came through
They said he'd soon be home
She had to pack a case
And they would make a rendezvous
But now a year has passed
And not a single word
And all the love she knew
Has disappeared out in the haze
Cambodia - Don't cry now - No tears now

And now the years have passed
With not a single word
But there is only one thing left
I know for sure
She won't see his face again"
1142,1143,Message To My Girl,Split Enz,1984,"I don't want to say, ""I love you""

I don't want to say, ""I want you""
Even though I want you so much
It's wrapped up in conversation
It's whispered in a hush

Though I'm frightened by the words
Think it's time I made it heard

No more empty self-possession
Visions swept under the mat
It's no New Year's resolution
It's more than that

Now, I wake up happy
Warm in a lover's embrace
No one else can touch us
While we're in this place

So I'll sing it to the world
This simple message to my girl

No more empty self-possession
Visions swept under the mat
It's no New Year's resolution
It's more than that

Though I'm frightened by the words
Think it's time I made it heard
So I'll sing it to the world
A simple message to my girl

No more empty self-possession
Visions swept under the mat
It's no New Year's resolution
It's more than that

Oh, there's nothing quite as real
As the touch of your sweet hand
I can't spend the rest of my life
Buried in the sand

Oh, every night I hear you call my name
I'm gonna sleep in my thoughts that roam

And the world feels like graves of dirt
Just close your eyes until
You can imagine this place
Yeah, our secret space, at will

Shut your eyes, I'll spin the big chair
And you'll feel dizzy, light and free
And falling gently on the cushion
You can come and sing to me

And the world feels like graves of dirt
Just close your eyes until
You can imagine this place
Yeah, our secret space, at will

And you make me feel
And you make me show
What I'm trying to conceal

Would you let me down?
Would you laugh at me?
If I said I care for you?
Could you feel the same way too?

Along the boulevard
But I have no friends, no one to see
And I'm never invited
But now I am here, I'm ready to go
Along is in the park
I don't know what I'm talking to you
No wonder I get excited

And do my best to win

Slow down, little one
You can't keep running away
You mustn't go outside yet

With the skylight in your eyes
Reaching out to gods

How big a hole would it leave

Let's pretend we never met
Let's pretend we're on our own
We live different lives
Until our cover's blown
I push my hand up to the sky
Shade my eyes from the sun
As the dust settles around me
Suddenly nighttime has begun

How big a hole would it leave
In the surface of the earth

You knew you were lost
But you carried on anyway
Oh, come on now

1160,1161,Jacob's Song,Douwe Bob,2016,"I could say I understand you
But I'm sorry that I don't
You know I'd fall into your arms right now
You'd rather be alone

We could use our breath to fix this
And fix this and fix this again
Words could calm us for a while you know
'Til storm comes 'round again

Now there's so much left to fight for
But nothing left to show
The only one I'd kill for
Doesn't need me anymore

Will the circle be unbroken?
Are we gonna break our hearts?
If we are to spend our lives apart
Words should be left unspoken

Now there's so much left to fight for
But nothing left to show
The only one I'd kill for
Doesn't need me anymore x2"
1161,1162,How To Save A Life,Fray,2007,"Step one: you say, ""We need to talk""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through

Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence

Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And pray to God he hears you

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or brake with the ones you've followed

He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life"

To the song here in my heart
A melody I start but can't complete
Listen
To the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release
Oh, the time has come
For my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all cause you won't listen

Listen
I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I've followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

You should have listened
There is someone here inside
Someone I thought had died so long ago
Oh, I'm screaming out
And my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worse
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

Listen
I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I've followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't

Just

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be
A woman
I just wanna be a woman

We're all looking at a different picture
Through this new frame of mind
A thousand flowers could bloom
Move over and give us some room
Yeah

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be
A woman
I just wanna be a woman

So don't you stop bein' a man
Just take a little look
From our side when you can
Sow a little tenderness
No matter if you cry

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be
A woman
I just wanna be a woman
It's all I wanna be is a woman

For this is the beginning of forever and ever
It's time to move over

I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
You've built a love, but that love falls apart
Your little piece of heaven turns to dark

Listen to your heart when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye

Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah
They're swept away and nothing is what it seems
The feeling of belonging to your dreams

Listen to your heart when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye

And there are voices that want to be heard
So much to mention but you can't find the words
The scent of magic, the beauty that's been (beauty that's been)
When love was wilder than the wind

Listen to your heart (take a listen to it) when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart (take a listen to it) there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going, and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before...

Oh, listen to your heart (take a listen to it) when he's calling for you
Listen to your heart (take a listen to it) there's nothing else you can do
I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart, before
You tell him goodbye

I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, loved, loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Do you want to, come on
Scooch on over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
So please don't please don't please don't
There's no need to complicate

1172,1173,Foto Van Vroeger,Rob de Nijs,1980,"Hier heb ik nog een foto van heel lang geleden
Maar als ik blijf kijken dan wordt het weer heden
Gemaakt op de ochtend van mijn vijfde verjaardag
De kamer vol slingers, 't cadeau dat al klaar lag
Het schippersclaviertje, de wens van mijn dromen
Heb ik 's middags nog mee naar het circus genomen
En brandweerman worden was het doel van het leven
Die dromen zijn over, 't gevoel is gebleven 

Refrain:
Diep in m'n hart verlang ik vaak naar dat kind terug
Kinderen willen groot zijn, nou dat gaat vlug
Als me het leven tegenzit, denk ik aan die tijd
Al werd ik nooit die brandweerman, raakte het kind niet kwijt 

Toen leek alles heel simpel, geen zorgen geen twijfel
Van goed kwam het goede en het kwaad van de duivel
De klok aan de muur hing daar puur voor het mooie
Ik had alle tijd in de buurt rond te schooien
Een zee was een slootje, m'n klomp was een bootje
En de dood was zoiets als de poes van m'n grootje
De wereld was niet groter dan de globe van vader
Ik kan hem met m'n pink om z'n as laten draaien 

Refrain 

Alleen zijn of eenzaam hoe kon ik dat kennen
Ik hoefde alleen maar naar huis toe te rennen
Met een gat in m'n kop en m'n broek vol met scheuren
Mijn moeder was thuis dus wat kon me gebeuren 

Als me het leven tegenzit, denk ik aan die tijd
Al werd ik nooit een Ivanhoe, raakte het kind niet kwijt"
1173,1174,The Rising,Bruce Springsteen,2002,"Can't see nothin' in front of me
Can't see nothin' coming up behind
I make my way through this darkness
I can't feel nothing but this chain that binds me

Lost track of how far I've gone
How far I've gone, how high I've climbed
On my back's a sixty pound stone
On my shoulder a half mile of line

Come on up for the rising
Come on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight

Left the house this morning
Bells ringing filled the air
I was wearin' the cross of my calling
On wheels of fire I come rollin' down here

Come on up for the rising
Come on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight

Lalala...

There's spirits above and behind me
Faces gone black, eyes burnin' bright
May their precious blood bind me
Lord, as I stand before your fiery light

Lalala...

I see you, Mary, in the garden
In the garden of a thousand sighs
There's holy pictures of our children
Dancin' in a sky filled with light

May I feel your arms around me
May I feel your blood mixed with mine
A dream of life comes to me
Like a catfish dancing on the end of my line

Sky of blackness and sorrow (A dream of life)
Sky of love, sky of tears (A dream of life)
Sky of glory and sadness (A dream of life)
Sky of mercy, sky of fear (A dream of life)

Sky of memory and shadow (A dream of life)
Your burnin' wind fills my arms tonight (A dream of life)
Sky of longing and emptiness (A dream of life)
Sky of fullness, sky of blessed life

Come on up for the rising
Come on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight

Lalala...

Come on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight)"

1175,1176,Your Latest Trick,Dire Straits,1985,"All the late night bargains have been struck
Between the satin beaus and their belles
Prehistoric garbage trucks
Have the city to themselves
Echoes roars dinosaurs
They're all doing the monster mash
And most of the taxis, most of the whores
Are only taking calls for cash

Mmmm, I don't know how it happened
It all took place so quick
But all I can do is hand it to you
And your latest trick

Well now my door was standing open
Security was laid back and lax
But it was only my heart got broken
You must have had a passkey made out of wax
You played robbery with insolence
And I played the blues in twelve bars down Lover's Lane
And you never did have the intelligence to use
The twelve keys hanging off my chain

Mmmm, I don't know how it happened
It all took place so quick
But all I can do is hand it to you
And your latest trick

Now it's past last call for alcohol
Past recall has been here and gone
The landlord he finally paid us all
The satin jazzmen have put away their horns
And we're standing outside of this wonderland
Looking so bereaved and so bereft
Like a Bowery bum when he finally understands
The bottle's empty and there's nothing left

Mmmm, I don't know how it happened
It was faster than the eye could flick
But all I can do is hand it to you
And your latest trick"

On the banks of the river Nile
Here comes the boat only half-afloat
Oarsman grins a toothless smile
Only just one more to this desolate shore
Last boat along the river Nile
Doesn't seem to care, no more wind in his hair
As he reaches his last half mile
The oar snaps in his hand before he reaches dry land
But the sound doesn't deafen his smile
Just pokes at wet sand with an oar in his hand
Floats off down the river Nile
Floats off down the river Nile

All aboard, night boat to Cairo

Were the gifts you gave

And the first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hands
Like the trembling heart
Of a captive bird
That was there at my command, my love

And the first time ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I knew our joy
Would fill the earth
And last till the end of time, my love

Does she speak eloquently? And would she have your baby?
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother

'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died?
'Til you died? But you're still alive

And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me

You seem very well
Things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well

I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face, how quickly I was replaced
And are you thinking of me when you fuck her?

'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name 
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died?
'Til you died? but you're still alive

And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

Ooh
Ahh
Ooh ah
Oh ah ah
Ooh ah
Ah ah ah oh

'Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me
And I'm not gonna fade as soon as you close your eyes
And you know it
And every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back
I hope you feel it
Well, can you feel it?

Well, I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

Well, I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know"
1182,1183,I Wish,Stevie Wonder,1977,"Lookin' back on when I was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes would not get a thing
We were happy with the joy the day would bring

Sneaking out the back door to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door with, ""Boy, thought I told you not to go outside!""
Tryin' your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinkin' it might stop her from woopin' your behind

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days e-ver have to go?
I wish those days could, come back once more
Why did those days e-ver have to go?
'Cause I love them so

Brother says he's tellin' 'bout you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell, an' I'll give you anythin' you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy, after church is through

Smokin' cigarettes, writing something nasty on the wall (You nasty boy!)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right
But while you were doin' it it sure felt outta sight

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days e-ver have to go?
I wish those days could, come back once more
Why did those days e-ver have to go?"
1183,1184,Dodenrit,Drs. P,1974,"We rijden met de trojka door het eindeloze woud
Het vriest een graad of dertig, het is winter en vrij koud
De paardehoeven knersen in de pasgevallen sneeuw
't Is avond in Siberië en nergens is een leeuw

We reizen met de kinderen, al zijn ze nog wat jong
Door 't eindeloze woud waarover ik zoëven zong
Een lommerrijk en zeer onoverzichtelijk terrein
Waarin men zich gelukkig prijst dat er geen leeuwen zijn

We zijn op weg naar Omsk, maar de weg daarheen is lang
En daarom vullen wij de tijd met feestelijk gezang
Intussen gaat zich iets bewegen in de achtergrond:
Iets donkers en iets talrijks en het lijkt me ongezond

Ze zijn nog vrij ver achter ons, ik zie ze echter wel
Het is een hele massa en ze lopen nogal snel
En door ons achterna te lopen halen zij ons in
Wat onvoordelig uit kan pakken voor een jong gezin

De donkere gedaanten zijn bijzonder vlug ter been
Ze lopen op vier poten, en ze kijken heel gemeen
Ze hebben grote tanden, dat is duidelijk te zien
Het zijn waarschijnlijk wolven en kwaadaardig bovendien

Al is de toestand zorgelijk, ik raak niet in paniek
Ik houd de moed erin door middel van de volksmuziek
We kennen onze bundel en we zingen heel wat af
Terwijl de wolven nader komen in gestrekte draf

Het is van hier naar Omsk nog een kleine honderd werst
't Is prettig dat de paarden net vanmiddag zijn ververst
Wel jammer dat de wolven ons toch hebben ingehaald
Men ziet de flinke eetlust die hun uit de ogen straalt

We doen heel onbekommerd en we zingen continu
Toch moet er iets gebeuren onder moeders paraplu
En zonder op te vallen overleg ik met mijn vrouw
""Wie moet er aan geloven,"" vraag ik, ""Toe, bedenk eens gauw""

""Moet Igor het maar wezen?"", ""Nee, want Igor speelt viool""
""Wat vind je van Natasja?"", ""Maar die leert zo goed op school!""
""En Sonja dan?"", ""Nee, Sonja niet, zij heeft een mooie alt""
Zodat de keus tenslotte op de kleine Pjotr valt.

Dus onder het gezang pak ik het ventje handig beet
Daar vliegt hij uit de trojka met een griezelige kreet
De wolven hebben alle aandacht voor die lekkernij
Nog vierentachtig werst en o, wat zijn wij heden blij

We mogen Pjotr wel waarderen om zijn eetbaarheid
Want daardoor raken wij die troep voorlopig even kwijt
Zo jagen wij maar voort als in een gruwelijke droom
Ajo ajo ajo al in die hoge klapperboom

Daar klinkt weer dat gehuil en onze hoop is weer verscheurd
De wolven zijn terug en nu is Sonja aan de beurt
Daar gaat het arme kind, zij was zo vrolijk en zo braaf
Nog achtenzestig werst en in Den Haag daar woont een graaf

Ik zit nog na te peinzen en mijn vrouw stort meen'ge traan
En kijk daar komen achter ons die wolven al weer aan
Dus Igor, 't is wel spijtig maar jij wordt geen virtuoos
Nog tweeënvijftig werst en daar was laatst een meisje loos

Nu Igor is verwijderd hebben wij weer even rust
Maar nee, daar zijn de wolven weer, op nog een part belust
De doodskreet van Natasja snijdt ons pijnlijk door de ziel
Nog zesendertig werst en in een blauwgeruite kiel

Mijn vrouw en ik zijn over, dus we zingen een duet
En als 't even mee wil zitten halen we het net
Helaas, ik moet haar afstaan aan de hongerige troep
Nu nog maar twintig werst en Hoeperdepoep zat op de stoep

Ik zing nu weer wat lustiger want Omsk komt in zicht
Ik maak een sprong van blijdschap en verlies mijn evenwicht
Terwijl de wolven mij verslinden, denk ik ""Dat is pech
Ja Omsk is een mooie stad, maar net iets te ver weg""

1184,1185,Mijn Vlakke Land,Jacques Brel,1965,"Wanneer de Noordzee koppig breekt aan hoge duinen
En witte vlokken schuim uiteenslaan op de kruinen
Wanneer de norse vloed beukt aan het zwart basalt
En over dijk en duin de grijze nevel valt
Wanneer bij eb het strand woest is als een woestijn
En natte westenwinden gieren van venijn
Dan vecht mijn land
Mijn vlakke land!

Wanneer de regen daalt op straten, pleinen, perken
Op dak en torenspits van hemelhoge kerken
Die in dit vlakke land de enige bergen zijn
Wanneer onder de wolken mensen dwergen zijn
Wanneer de dagen gaan in domme regelmaat
En bolle oostenwind het land nog vlakker slaat
Dan wacht mijn land
Mijn vlakke land!

Wanneer de lage lucht vlak over het water scheert
Wanneer de lage lucht ons nederigheid leert
Wanneer de lage lucht er grijs als leisteen is
Wanneer de lage lucht er vaal als kleileem is
Wanneer de noordewind de vlakte vierendeelt
Wanneer de noordewind er onze adem steelt
Dan kraakt mijn land
Mijn vlakke land!

Wanneer de Schelde blinkt in zuidelijke zon
En elke Vlaamse vrouw flaneert in zonjapon
Wanneer de eerste spin z'n lente-webben weeft
Of dampende het veld in julizonlicht beeft
Wanneer de zuidenwind er schatert door het graan
Wanneer de zuidenwind er jubelt langs de baan
Dan juicht mijn land
Mijn vlakke land!"

In a city that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill,
Top of the heap...

In old New York.
If I can make it there,

Sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

I think I love you better now, now

I'm gonna paint you by numbers and color you in
If things go right, we can frame it and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart and swap it for yours

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done

1188,1189,De Weg,Guus Meeuwis,2005,"Ik kan nauwelijks wat zien,
door de waas voor m'n ogen
leek alles gelogen
al het mooie lijkt dood
ik heb zelfs de kracht niet om op te geven
al wil ik het niet
het leven gaat door

We leefden ons leven
om samen te sterven
De bergen beklommen en de dalen gedicht
in het diepst van de nacht
zelfs de zon laten schijnen
niets wat niet kon 
en niets was teveel 

we wilden geloven, in het eeuwige leven
ons samen verscholen, een wanhopig getroost
we hebben de waarheid
zo diep als kon begraven
'k was één met een engel 
zo lang het mocht

Waar jij verscheen
scheen de zon met je mee
geen tijd voor verdriet
maar elke dag omarmd
en altijd vrolijk 
hoe jij dat voor elkaar kreeg 
met oneindig veel moed 
het leven is niet fair

de dans, gedanst, op een zilveren tapijt
met jou dicht bij mij 
de verloren tijd beweent 
doelloos verzonken en dronken
en niets dat niet mocht
wij twee door de tijd
de tijd heen
midzomernacht droom

waar jij verscheen
scheen de zon met je mee
geen tijd voor verdriet
maar elke dag omarmd
en altijd vrolijk 
hoe jij dat voor elkaar kreeg 
met oneindig veel moed 
het leven is niet fair

Jouw stralende lach
en je mooie gedichten
jou tedere woorden 
je onverwoestbaar krachtige wil
je hebt je noodlot
steeds het hoofd geboden
tot het eind geloofde je
jouw idee van geluk
jouw idee van geluk

ik ga niet weg 
k'heb nog wat tijd gekregen
k'zal altijd maar door gaan
tot aan het eind 
ik heb je voor altijd, m'n hart gegeven
ik draag je bij me, tot het licht straks dooft
ik draag je bij me, tot het licht straks dooft"
1189,1190,You Can't Hurry Love,Phil Collins,1982,"I need love, love to ease my mind
I need to find time
Someone to call mine
But mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust on my good times
No matter how long it takes

But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength
Ooh, it's almost gone
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait
How much more can I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart, heart to break

Now I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
Well these precious words keep me hangin' on
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust on my good times
No matter how long it takes
(Well now wait)

No love, love don't come easy
But I keep on waitin'
Anticipating for that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight
I keep waiting
Keep on waitin'
Until that day
But it ain't easy yeah
It ain't easy
But mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy

1190,1191,Hello,Lionel Richie,1984,"I've been alone with you inside my mind
And in my dreams, I've kissed your lips a thousand times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door
Hello, is it me you're looking for?

I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile
You're all I've ever wanted
And my arms are open wide

'Cause you know just what to say
And you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much
I love you

I long to see the sunlight in your hair
And tell you time and time again how much I care
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow
Hello, I've just got to let you know

'Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely
Or is someone loving you?

Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying
I love you

Hello, is it me you're looking for?

But I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely
Is someone loving you?

Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying
I love you"
1191,1192,Hemel Valt,Typhoon,2015,"Wat zijn woorden opgeschreven als de kern ervan niet wordt begrepen
Voorbij het punt van lezen is het de kunst van leven
Tussen de regels, buiten de kantlijn
Hoe anders zou het zijn? Hoe anders zou het zijn?
Ben een gezegend man maar een man met gebreken
Soms belabberd, niet eerlijk, soms te berekenen
Alles op de tekentafel
Liefde... geven is makkelijk maar ontvangen van een ander kaliber
Je kent m'n streken en m'n kracht
Kent de muziek, de poëzie en wat het heeft gebracht
En ik ben dankbaar voor mijn lach
Als ik dat niet had was ik depri of suicidaal
Ze zeggen 'doe normaal, verman jezelf'
Al gaat het goed, dit paradijs lijkt soms verdacht op een hel
Maar goed, ik sta versteld, sta stil en herinner me
Alles is er al van binnen

Als de hemel valt, de hemel valt
De druk op God wordt groter en ze draagt het allemaal
Maar als de hemel valt, zullen we het samen moeten dragen
En kunnen Zij en Allah samen even weg

Misschien ben ik een domme jongen maar mijn God zeg me
Waarom men zonden blijft verkondigen als liefde de bron is
Dat is geen brood maar kruimels uit mensen handen
Niet de jou of een zogenaamde duivel
Zeg, hoe is het nou?
Als een multi-splagaar
Er altijd zijn voor iedereen en alles
Beetje zoals m'n eigen ma
Zij is te goed voor deze wereld
We willen meer, plus door de crisis is iedereen skeer
En dan die eeuwige strijd
Klokdrama aan de deur, het genieten van de partij, ja
Ja we willen ons gelijk
Opgehangen aan ideeën van 't liefst één waarheid
Liefje hoe zou het zijn, even een break
Telekinetisch of met de trein
Pootje baden in het universum, modderbad, verse koffie en de ochtendkrant

Als de hemel valt, de hemel valt
De druk op God wordt groter en ze draagt het allemaal
Maar als de hemel valt, zullen we het samen moeten dragen
En kunnen Zij en Allah samen even weg"

These shallow waters never met what I needed
I'm letting go a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea. I'm breathing alive

Under the bright but faded lights
You've set my heart on fire

How you was, where you could be found
Told them you were living downtown
Driving all the old men crazy

Every night, she'd be on the floor shaking what she'd got
Man, when I tell you she was cool, she was red hot        
I mean, she was steaming

And that time over at Johnny's place
Well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face
Man, we just fell about the place

Friday night, they'll be dressed to kill
Down at Dino's Bar and Grill
The drink will flow and blood will spill
And if the boys want to fight, you better let them

The nights are gettin' warmer, it won't be long
Won't be long 'til summer comes

Lying in the depths of your imagination
Worlds above and worlds below
The sun shines on the black clouds hanging over the domain

Even when you're feeling warm
The temperature could drop away
Like four seasons in one day

Smiling as the shit comes down
You can tell a man from what he has to say
Everything gets turned around
And I will risk my neck again, again

You can take me where you will
Up the creek and through the mill
Like all the things you can't explain
Four seasons in one day

Blood dries up
Like rain, like rain
Fills my cup
Like four seasons in one day

It doesn't pay to make predictions
Sleeping on an unmade bed
Finding out wherever there is comfort there is pain
Only one step away
Like four seasons in one day

Blood dries up
Like rain, like rain
Fills my cup
Like four seasons in one day"

Ik verlangde zo naar jou hier aan mijn zij

Ja, ik denk nog steeds
Hoe het was geweest
Toen je naast me zat hier aan de bar

Ik vroeg: ""Drink je mee?""
Dat vond jij oké
Toen je proostte, naar me keek, werd ik zo week

Een beetje verliefd (Een beetje verliefd)
Ik dacht 'n beetje verliefd (Ahahaha)
Als ik wist wat jij toen dacht
Had ik nooit op jou gewacht

Als een kind zat ik te dromen
Deze nacht ben jij voor mij
Maar die droom ging snel voorbij

Jij stond op en zei: 
""Hou m'n plaatsje vrij
Ik moet even weg maar ben zo terug""

Ach, die kruk bleef leeg
Tot ik in de gaten kreeg
Dat je weg ging zonder mij, ik was weer alleen

Een beetje verliefd (Een beetje verliefd)
Ik dacht 'n beetje verliefd (Ahahaha)
Als ik wist wat jij toen dacht
Had ik nooit op jou gewacht

Als een kind zat ik te dromen

Een beetje verliefd (Een beetje verliefd)

Als ik wist wat jij toen dacht
Had ik nooit op jou gewacht

Als een kind zat ik te dromen
Deze nacht ben jij voor mij
Maar die droom ging snel voorbij"
1199,1200,She Flies On Strange Wings,Golden Earring,1971,"Lonely is the night without you
Just as lonely as a shepherd without sheep
And where flies the falcon in the high sweet air
Without hunting his prey in valleys deep

She wears softness as a gown
She spreads magic all around
Her feathers still untouched
Takes but nothing and she gives so much

She flies on strange wings
She flies on strange winds
She brings strange things
She flies on strange wings

She takes off when she desires
Silence grows on her lips
She can bring you so much higher
She spreads love on all her trips, yeah

She flies on strange wings
She flies on strange winds
She brings strange things
She flies on strange wings

Woke up this morning
And this feeling came to my head
To fly with her from sky to sky
'Cause my mind seemed to be dead
So I floated up towards her
On my mutilated wings
But all the blackness sings against me now
It's the lady of the strange wings
(It's the lady of the strange wings)
It's the lady of the strange wings


Oh, it's the lady, it's the lady,
the lady of the strange wings

She wears softness as a gown
She spreads magic all around
Her feathers still untouched
Takes but nothing and she gives so much

She flies on strange wings
She flies on strange winds
She brings strange things
She flies on strange wings"
1200,1201,Hilversum 3,Herman Van Veen,1984,"Vroeger werd gezongen en gefloten in de straat,
had de slagersjongen nog een opera paraat,
de metselaar kon zingend op de steiger staan,
de melkboer lengde fluitend zijn melk een beetje aan.

Hilversum III bestond nog niet,
maar ieder had zijn eigen stem.
Op elke steiger klonk een lied,
van Paljas of Jeruzalem.

Alle venters hadden eigen aria's,
voor sprot en haring, voor begonia's.
Zelfs in de fabrieken kwam van overal
toch weer een liedje door de grote hal.

Hilversum III bestond nog niet,
maar ieder had zijn eigen stem.
Op elke steiger klonk een lied,
van Paljas of Jeruzalem.

Tussen het geratel van machines door,
klonk in de confectie een mooi meisjeskoor,
dromend van de prins van... weet ik veel,
die ze zou ontvoeren naar zijn luchtkasteel.

Hilversum III bestond nog niet,
maar ieder had zijn eigen stem.
Op elke steiger klonk een lied,
van Paljas of Jeruzalem.

Oh brother, I can't believe it's true
I'm so scared about the future and I wanna talk to you
Oh I wanna talk to you

You could take a picture of something you see
And in the future, where would I be?
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do something that's never been done

Are you lost or incomplete?
Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?
Tell me how you feel
Well I feel like they're talkin' in a language I don't speak
And they're talking it to me

So you take a picture of something you see
And in the future, where will I be?
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do something that's never been done
Do something that's never been done


So you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk
And you feel like you're going where you've been before

So that's why you've got to try
You got to breathe and have some fun
Though I'm not paid, I play this game
And I won't stop until I'm done

But what I really want to know is
Are you gonna go my way?
And I got to, got to know, eh

I don't know why we always cry
This we must leave and get undone
We must engage and rearrange
And turn this planet back to one

So tell me why we got to die
And kill each other one by one
We've got to hug and rub-a-dub
We've got to dance and be in love

But what I really want to know is
Are you gonna go my way?
And I gotta, gotta know

Are you gonna go my way?
'Cause, baby, I got to know, yeah"

Can't I take away all this pain?

And when you come, my heart will be waiting
To make sure that you're never alone

There and then, I will make you my own

Nothing to eat, no books to read

Making love with you
Has left me peaceful, warm and tired

There's nothing left to be desired

And it leaves me weak
So sleep, silent angel, go to sleep

And to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe
Yes, to love you

1210,1211,Nederwiet,Doe Maar,1983,"Dit is een lied over een plant
een groene plant, een mooie plant
een welriekende plant, een grote, een sterke
ja, een nuttige plant
Het gaat over de Cannabis sativa 'Hollandica'
oftewel Nederwiet - wiedewiedewiet - jaja

We beginnen met het zaad
het goede zaad is van een plant
die al minstens drie generaties
in Nederland groeit en bloeit
Sommige mensen zeggen zeven
maar dat is een kwestie van geloof, geloof ik
dat mag je dus zelf weten, goed
het goede zaad doe je in 
maart april mei in de grond
voorkiemen en zo
dat is allemaal maar haastige spoed
het plantje weet zelf het beste
wanneer het op moet komen
dus laat maar gaan
dat gaat wel goed
dat wordt prachtige nederwiedewiedewiedewiet
net zo goed als congo indonesia acapulco colombia

En dan nu geduld
rustig op laten komen
het plantje is nog klein
bemoedigend toespreken dus
dan wordt het nog groter
en groter en groter
en het wordt zelfs nog groter en groter en groter
en het wordt dikker
en dan is het september
en tijd voor de oogst
de vrouwtjes met de zaadjes
en/of de bloemetjes haal je binnen
je legt ze op de grond of 
hangt ze met de voetjes aan het plafond
en dan wacht je 1 2 3 en een halve maand
tot het droog is en als het dan droog is 
dan komt het belangrijkste van de Cannabis Sattiva Hollandica
het uitzoeken van de blaadjes
Daar krijg je hoofdpijn van, ik wel
de blaadjes, daarvan krijg je een betonnen hoofd
dus die blaadjes, die gooi je weg weg
en je rookt alleen de hoesjes
van de zaadjes en/of de bloemetjes
en daarvan krijg je geen betonnen hoofd
en daarvan krijg je geen hoofdpijn
en daarvan wordt je niet draaierig
maar daarvan wordt je zo high
als een vlaamse papegaai,
dat is onze eigen nederwiet
daarvoor hoeft niemand in verre vreemde landen
in de bak te zitten
nederwiet nederwiet nederwiet
en verder gaat dit lied niet"

You've cut me and you've scarred me through and through
And I'll walk out a wiser, weaker man
Mr. Congressman, you can't understand.

San Quentin what good do you think you do?
Do you think I'll be different when you're through?
You bend my heart &amp; mind and you warp my soul
Your stone walls turn my blood a little cold

San Quentin may you rot and burn in hell
May your walls fall and may I live to tell
May all the world forget you ever stood
And the whole world will regret you did no good

The men who have served you so long and so well

Like the dolphin who guides you, you bring us beside you
To light up the darkness and show us the way
For though we are strangers in your silent world
To live on the land we must learn from the sea
To be true as the tide and free as a wind swell
Joyful and loving in letting it be

1219,1220,Why Worry,Dire Straits,1985,"Baby I see this world has made you sad
Some people can be bad
The things they do, the things they say
But baby I'll wipe away those bitter tears
I'll chase away those restless fears
That turn your blue skies into grey

Why worry, there should be laughter after pain
There should be sunshine after rain
These things have always been the same
So why worry now
Why worry now

Baby when I get down I turn to you
And you make sense of what I do
I know it isn't hard to say
But baby just when this world seems mean and cold
Our love comes shining red and gold
And all the rest is by the way

Why worry, there should be laughter after pain
There should be sunshine after rain
These things have always been the same
So why worry now
Why worry now"

Without even knowing
I'll never forget those days
Three days in a row
You were my love
And I haven't seen you since
That day
I'm sorry baby

Baby boy
When I saw
You the first time
I knew right-away that
You and I
Were connected
In a way, yeah,
I believed,
That there was a way
Something more
That I could ever express
In my own words
I Just knew
At the time I belonged
To you
But it all felt so wrong
To do the things that
My heart gave in baby
I'm telling you

I've been loving you
Without you even knowing
I'll never forget
Those days
Three days in a row
You were my love
And I haven't seen you since
That day
I'm sorry babe

With loafs on our minds, a few goodbyes
We could never
Have givin' it
A real try
But you were in my head always
And at this point in my life
I just know
That if you let me back in
I won't let go
Of you and me standing at last
I just know it's a matter of time
Before it all falls back into place, baby believe me

I've been loving you
Without you even knowing
I'll never forget
Those days.
Three days in a row
You were my love
And I haven't seen you since
That day
Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby

I've got the light,
And for you I will shine.
Just be prepared
For a hell of a ride
Don't ever die
By the way
I feel for ever seems short
I'm begging you
Ooooohaah

I've been loving you
Without you even knowing
I'll never forget
Those days
Three days in a row
You were my love
And I haven't seen you since that day"

'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said a-heaven ain't close in a place like this

Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight (Hoo hoo)
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight

Well, somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential

Ready, let's roll onto something new
Takin' its toll then I'm leaving without you
'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this

E questo bel dolore
Ti prego no, ti prego lo sai!

Che mi illumini il mondo
Buono come te...
Che ho bisogno, di qualcosa di vero
Che illumini il cielo

Le fughe e poi i ritorni

Were never to be

Though we're apart, you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill

Somethin’ never comes, never leads to nothin’
Nothin’ satisfies, but I’m getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope

All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around and it’s taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

Come down, don’t you resist
You have such a delicate wrist 
And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my grip

Will I find something in there
To give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one hidden up my sleeve
One by one hidden up my sleeve

Hey, don’t let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down

Hey, don’t let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down

Will I find a believer?
Another one who believes
Another one to deceive
Over and over down on my knees

If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on, I got nothing to hide
On and on, I got nothing to hide

Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down

Hey, don’t let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste

Closer to the prize at the end of the rope

When it comes around and it’s taken away
Leaves me with the feelin' that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

We've traveled halfway around the world to find ourselves again

September morn
We danced until the night became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes from some romantic play
September morning still can make me feel that way

Look at what you've done
Why you've become a grown up girl
I still can hear you crying
In the corner of your room
And look how far we've come
So far from where we used to be
But not so far that we've forgotten
How it was before

September morn
Do you remember how we danced that night away
Two lovers playing scenes from some romantic play
September morning still can make me feel that way

September morn
We danced until the night became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes from some romantic play
September morning still can make me feel that way

And stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life

Jump in the shower
And the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the streets, the traffic starts jumpin'
For folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

Workin' 9 to 5
What a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by
It's all takin' and no givin'

They just use your mind
And they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you
Crazy if you let it

9 to 5
For service and devotion
You would think that I
Would deserve a fat promotion

Want to move ahead
But the boss won't seem to let me 
I swear sometimes that man is
Out to get me, hmmm

They let you dream
Just a watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away

We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing
And there's no way we ever could

Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

Now, if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door

And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
'Cause when they own the information
They can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

We're still waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population

So we keep on waiting

in de kelder van de kroeg
waar de vaten rustig wachten
iedereen heeft toch genoeg

op de dansvloer van het leven
met een tango voor de boeg
kan het zomaar heftig stormen
ook als niemand er om vroeg

1257,1258,Geen Kind Meer,Karin Bloemen,1996,"Je leeft je eigen leven wat zij er ook van vindt 
 Je bent al lang geen kind meer al blijf je ook haar kind 
 Je wilt 'r over praten, maar niet op haar manier 
 Je zult haar best verdriet doen maar niet voor je plezier 
 Wat moet je nog met haar en met haar ouderlijk gezag 
 En dan opeens dan is 'ie er, die dag 

 De dag waarop je moeder sterft, dat jij wordt losgelaten 
 En al haar eigenschappen erft, in meer of mindere mate 
 De Scherpe tong, de bokkenpruik, de humorvolle vrouw 
 Die zullen ze dan binnenkort herkennen gaan in jou 
 En hopelijk ook de andere kant, de aardige, de zachte 
 Maar of je die hebt meegeerft valt nog maar af te wachten 
 De dag waarna de rest een kwestie wordt van tijd en pijn 
 De dag waarna je nooit meer kind zult zijn 

 Wat de laatste jaren fout ging komt dan niet meer terecht 
 En wat je nog wou zeggen blijft eeuwig ongezegd 
 De machteloze frasen van je genegenheid 
 Het leven voor haar zo moeilijk was en ook dat 't je spijt 
 De dingen die je lang niet zeggen kon en zeggen wou 
 En dan zo graag nog 1 keer zeggen zou 

 De dag waarop je moeder sterft, de dag die al je dagen 
 Van dan af aan wat grijzer verft, al hou je niks te klagen 
 Je hebt je goeie vrienden nog, die staan je ook dichtbij 
 En als je soms wat aandacht wil dan staan ze aan je zij
 Maar niemand zal meer weten hoe je met je pop kon spelen 
 En niemand zal nog ooit je vroegste vroeger met je delen 
 De dag waarna je nooit meer kwetsbaar wezen kunt en klein 
 De dag waarna je nooit meer kind zult zijn"

And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight

I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop

Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

As we saw, oh, this light, I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright, as we soar walls, every siren is a symphony
And every tear's a waterfall, is a waterfall, oh, is a waterfall,
Oh, is a, is a waterfall, every tear is a waterfall

So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still I'll raise the flag

An angel in disguise
Gone wild

But I thought you were a man
Who knew right from wrong
That's why I really don't understand
Why he's with her

It's killing me
What has she got that I don't have
Is it the way she looks at you
Laughs with you, can she,
Does she make you beg for more
This is hurting
What has she got that I don't have

I tried to call him
Anytime anywhere
But he's never there

So I went to his place
And waited all day
So he would explain it to me
And this is what he said:

There is nothing left to say
I had my fill, I went away
Your crying eyes won't change a thing
It was just a fling

Well how could an angel break my heart
He said: We could still be friends

Are you kidding me
What has she got that I don't have
Is it the way she looks at you
Talks to you, can she
Does she make you beg for more
This is hurting
What has she got that I don't have

But twice every year
When he's in tears
When he loses his mind
And can't help but cry
He'll call me and then

I am better than I am (x...)"
1262,1263,A Thing Called Love,Johnny Cash,1972,"Six foot six he stood on the ground, 
He weighed 235 pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by love

He was the kind of man that would gamble on luck
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup because of love

You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
But like the wind that covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of every man, this thing called love
It can lift you up, never let you down
Take your world and turn it all around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found stronger than love

Most men are like me, they worry and doubt
They trouble their minds day in and day out
Too busy with livin' to worry about a little word like love

But when I see a mother's tenderness
As she holds her young close to her breast
Then I thank God that the world's been blessed with the thing called love

You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
But like the wind that covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of every man, this thing called love
It can lift you up, never let you down
Take your world and turn it all around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found stronger than love"

To a hymn called ""Faith and Misery"" (Hey!)

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives

Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protester has crossed the line (Hey!)
To find the money's on the other side

Can I get another amen? (Amen!)

A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

Pulverize the Eiffel Towers

Kill all the fags that don't agree

Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

I saw the ghost of Elvis
On Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
Then I watched him walk right through

Now, security did not see him
They just hovered 'round his tomb
But there's a pretty little thing
Waiting for the King
Down in the jungle room

When I was walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

Now, they've got catfish on the table
They've got gospel in the air
And Reverend Green, be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
But boy you got a prayer in Memphis

Now, Muriel plays piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
Do a little number
And I sang with all my might
She said, ""Tell me are you a Christian, child?""
And I said, ""Ma'am, I am tonight!""

Catching the swirling wind, the sailor sees the rim of the land

Passing round the ready-rub
Trying not to think of when
The lunchtime bell will ring again.

But, did it really turn out bad
All I learnt at school
Was how to bend not break the rules
Oh what fun we had
But at the time it seemed so bad
Trying different ways
To make a difference to the days.

The headmaster's had enough today
All the kids have gone away
Gone to fight with next door's school
Every term, that is the rule
Sits alone and bends his cane
Same old backsides again
All the small ones tell tall tales
Walking home and squashing snails.

Lots of smells and lots of noise
Playing football in the park
Kicking pushbikes after dark

Pulling hair and eating dirt
Teacher comes to break it up
Back of the 'ead with a plastic cup.

Too blind to see the writing on the wall

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
Till then, it will burn inside of me

I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warmth she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside you - can't take that from me

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
Till then, it will burn inside of me

The truth is never far behind
You've kept it hidden well

Will I ever have the chance again?

If I'd run away
I'd never have the strength to go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart?
Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide? 
Will I grow old?
How will they hear?
When will they learn?
How will they know?

Doch die und Du ist, was mir jetzt so fehlt
Ich glaub' das einfach nicht
Gegenüber steht ein Telefon -
Es lacht mich ständig an voll Hohn
Es klingelt, klingelt aber nicht
Sieben Bier - zuviel geraucht
Das ist es, was ein Mann so braucht
Doch niemand, niemand sagt: ""Hör' auf""
Und ich denke schon wieder nur an Dich...

Verdammt - ich lieb' Dich -
Ich lieb' Dich nicht
Verdammt - ich brauch' Dich -
Ich brauch' Dich nicht
Verdammt - ich will Dich -
Ich will Dich nicht
Ich will Dich nicht verlier'n

Verdammt - ich lieb' Dich
Ich lieb' Dich nicht
Verdammt - ich brauch' Dich -
Ich brauch' Dich nicht
Verdammt - ich will Dich -
Ich will Dich nicht
Ich will Dich nicht verlier'n

Verdammt - ich lieb' Dich

Ich will Dich nicht verlier'n

Verdammt - ich lieb' Dich
Ich lieb' Dich nicht
Verdammt - ich brauch' Dich -
Ich brauch' Dich nicht..."
1279,1280,You'll Never Walk Alone,Lee Towers,1976,"When you walk
Through a storm
Hold your head, up high
And don't be afraid, of the dark
At the end of the storm
Is a golden sky
And the sweet silver song
Of a lark

Walk on, through the wind
Walk on, through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed
And blown

Walk on, walk on
With hope, in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone

Walk on, walk on
With hope in your hearts
And You'll never walk, alone
You'll never walk, alone

You'll never walk, alone

You'll never walk, alone"
1280,1281,Walk This Way,Run DMC ft. Aerosmith,1986,
1281,1282,The Living Years,Mike & The Mechanics,1989,"Every generation
Blames the one before
And all of their frustrations
Come beating on your door

I know that I'm a prisoner
To all my father held so dear
I know that I'm a hostage
To all his hopes and fears
I just wish I could have told him
In the living years

Oh, crumpled bits of paper
Filled with imperfect thought
Stilted conversations
I'm afraid that's all we've got

You say you just don't see it
He says it's perfect sense
You just can't get agreement
In this present tense
We all talk a different language
Talking in defense

(Say it loud) Say it loud
(Say it clear) Say it clear
(You can listen) As well as you hear

(It's too late) It's too late
(When we die) Oh, when we die
(To admit) We don't see eye to eye

So we open up a quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts

So don't yield to the fortunes
You sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective
On a different date
And if you don't give up and don't give in
You may just be okay

(Say it loud) Say it loud
(Say it clear) Say it clear
(You can listen) As well as you hear

(It's too late) It's too late
(When we die) Oh, when we die
(To admit) We don't see eye to eye

I wasn't there that morning
When my father passed away
I didn't get to tell him
All the things I had to say

I think I caught his spirit
Later that same year
I'm sure I heard his echo
In my baby's new born tears
I just wish I could have told him
In the living years

(Say it loud) So say it, say it, say it loud
(Say it clear) Oh, say it clear
(You can listen) As well as you hear

(It's too late) It's too late
(When we die) It's too late when we die
(To admit) We don't see eye to eye

(Say it loud) So say it, say it, say it loud
(Say it clear) Oh, say it clear
(Say it loud) Don't give up, don't give in
(Say it clear) Don't wait til it's too late"

1283,1284,Fireflies,Owl City,2009,"You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep

'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude, but I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they try to teach me how to dance

A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
(They said farewell)

But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar

Kijk om me heen
Alles lijkt veranderd
Mijn buik doet raar en ik voel me vreemd

En ik vraag me af wat dit gevoel veroorzaakt heeft
Mijn gedachten lijken zelfs niet meer van mij
Kan mezelf niet vinden
En de reden dat ben jij

Je bent binnen
binnen in mijn hart
binnen in mijn ziel
Van binnen
binnen sinds de dag dat ik voor jou viel
binnen
binnen in de droom die ik met je wil beginnen
je bent binnen
binnen....

het leven werd door mij alleen geregisseerd
maar zonder iets te zeggen (met mezelf te overleggen)
heb ik alle rollen omgekeerd
en ik vraag me af waarom ik doe wat ik nu doe
maar het antwoord op die vraag komt niet van mij
ik lijk gek te worden
en de reden dat ben jij

Je bent binnen
binnen in mijn hart
binnen in mijn ziel
Van binnen
binnen sinds de dag dat ik voor jou viel
binnen
binnen in de droom die ik met je wil beginnen
je bent binnen

Ik zit bij jou achterop de fiets
we gaan steeds iets harder
ik zie bijna niets
ik sta voor de keuze
nu er af of voor altijd mee
ik besluit de angsten van me af te slaan
en voor altijd met je mee te gaan
mn hoofd tegen je rug gedrukt
en mijn armen om je heen....

Binnen!
Binnen in mn hart binnen in mn ziel
van binnen
binnen sinds de dag dat ik voor jou viel

1285,1286,Greatest Love Of All,Whitney Houston,1986,"I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride
To make it easier
Let the children's laughter
Remind us how we used to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I beg and I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest
Love of all inside of me

The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride
To make it easier
Let the children's laughter
Remind us how we used to be

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I beg and I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest
Love of all inside of me

The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

And if by chance that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love"

We can steal it

Controllin' my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me, girl

Livin' on the music so fine
Born on the wind
Makin' it mine

We know how to show it

In the heat of our love
Don't need no help for us to make it
Gimme just enough
To take us to the mornin'

I get higher in my walkin'
And I'm glowing in the dark
I give you warning

And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
Controllin' my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me, girl

Past painted deserts, the sun sets on fire
As he carries me home to the Mull of Kintyre

Sweep through the heather like deer in the glen
Carry me back to the days I knew then
Nights when we sang like a heavenly choir
Of the life and the times of the Mull of Kintyre

Mull of Kintyre
Oh, mist rolling in from the sea
My desire is always to be here
Oh, Mull of Kintyre

Smiles in the sunshine and tears in the rain
Still take me back where my memories remain
Flickering embers grow higher and higher
As they carry me back to the Mull of Kintyre

Dan gaat de hemel een klein beetje open
Sterren, je laat ze verbleken
Met je ogen die altijd stralen

Jij kan de zon laten schijnen
Want je loopt langs en de wolken verdwijnen
En als je lacht, lacht heel de wereld mee

De meeste dromen zijn bedrog
Maar als ik wakker word naast jou dan droom ik nog
Ik voel je adem en zie je gezicht
Je bent een droom die naast me ligt
Je kijkt me aan en rekt je uit
Een keer in de zoveel tijd komen dromen uit

Jij moet me een ding beloven
Laat me nog lang in mijn dromen geloven
Zelfs als je even niet hier bent
Blijf in mijn slaap dan bij me

En als de zon weer gaat schijnen
Laat dan dat beeld wat ik heb niet verdwijnen
Als je zou gaan neem je mijn dromen mee

De meeste dromen zijn bedrog
Maar als ik wakker wordt naast jou dan droom ik nog
Ik voel je adem en zie je gezicht
Je bent een droom die naast me ligt
Je kijkt me aan en rekt je uit
Een keer in de zoveel tijd komen dromen uit

Ooh jij kan de zon laten schijnen

En als je lacht, lacht heel de wereld mee

Maar als ik wakker word naast jou dan droom ik nog
Ik voel je adem en zie je gezicht

Je kijkt me aan en rekt je uit

And it's no, nay, never
No, nay, never, no more
Will I play the wild rover
No, never, no more

I went into an ale house I used to frequent
And I told the landlady me money was spent
I asked her for credit, she answered me ""Nay""
""Such a custom as yours I can have every day""

And it's no, nay, never
No, nay, never, no more
Will I play the wild rover
No, never, no more

I then took from me pocket ten sovereigns bright
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight

""And the words that you told me were only in jest""

And it's no, nay, never
No, nay, never, no more
Will I play the wild rover
No, never, no more

I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done
And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son
And when they've caressed me as oft' times before

With every bubble she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run

Run fast for your mother, fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind

'Cause here they come

And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had and what was left after that, too, oh

Struck from a great height by someone who should've known better than that

With one hand you calm me
With one hand I'm still
With one hand you calm me
With one hand I'm still

People are fragile things
You should know by now
Be careful what you put them through
People are fragile things
You should know by now

You'll speak when you're spoken to
He'll speak when he's spoken to
She'll speak when she's spoken to"

1298,1299,It Was A Very Good Year,Frank Sinatra,1968,"When I was seventeen
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for small town girls
And soft summer nights
We'd hide from the lights
On the village green
When I was seventeen

When I was twenty-one
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for city girls
Who lived up the stair
With all that perfumed hair
And it came undone
When I was twenty-one

When I was thirty-five
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls
Of independent means
We'd ride in limousines
Their chauffeurs would drive
When I was thirty-five

But now the days are short
I'm in the autumn of the year
And now I think of my life as vintage wine
From fine old kegs
From the brim to the dregs
And it poured sweet and clear
It was a very good year

It was a massive good year"
1299,1300,A Change Is Gonna Come,Sam Cooke,1964,"I was born by the river in a little tent
Oh, and just like the river, I've been running ever since
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gonna come, oh yes it will

It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die
'Cause I don't know what's up there beyond the sky
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gonna come, oh yes it will

I go to the movie, and I go downtown
Somebody keep telling me don't hang around
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gonna come, oh yes it will

Then I go to my brother
And I say, brother, help me, please
But he winds up knocking me
Back down on my knees

Oh, there been times that I thought I couldn't last for long
But now I think I'm able to carry on
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change gonna come, oh yes it will"

And the lights are flashing on your window sill
All alone ain't much fun, so you're looking for the thrill
And you know just what it takes and where to go

Don't say a prayer for me now
Save it till the morning after
No, don't say a prayer for me now
Save it till the morning after

Feel the breeze deep on the inside, look you down into your well
If you can, you'll see the world in all his fire
Take a chance, like all dreamers can't find another way
You don't have to dream it all, just live a day

Don't say a prayer for me now
Save it till the morning after
No, don't say a prayer for me now
Save it till the morning after
Save it till the morning after
Save it till the morning after

Pretty looking road, I try to hold the rising floods that fill my skin
Don't ask me why I'll keep my promise, melt the ice
And you wanted to dance so I asked you to dance, but fear is in your soul
Some people call it a one night stand, but we can call it paradise

Don't say a prayer for me now
Save it till the morning after
No, don't say a prayer for me now
Save it till the morning after
Save it till the morning after

1304,1305,Babel,Mumford & Sons,2013,"'Cause I know that time has numbered my days
And I'll go along with everything you say
But I'll ride home laughing, look at me now
The walls of my town, they come crumbling down

And my ears hear the call of my unborn sons
And I know that choices color all I've done
But I'll explain it all to the watchman's son,
I ain't ever lived a year better spent in love

'Cause I'll know my weakness, know my voice,
And I'll believe in grace and choice
And I know perhaps my heart is fast,
But I'll be born without a mask

Like the city that nurtured my greed and my pride,
I stretch my arms into the sky
I cry Babel! Babel! Look at me now
But the walls of my town, they come crumbling down

You ask where will we stand in the winds that will howl,
As all we see will slip into the cloud
So come down from your mountain and stand where we've been,
You know our breath is weak and our bodies thin

Press my nose up to the glass around your heart
I should've known I was weaker from the start
You'll build your walls and I will play my bloody part
To tear, tear them down. Well I'm gonna tear, tear them down!

'Cause I know my weakness know my voice, and I'll believe in grace and choice
And I know perhaps my heart is fast, but I'll be born without a mask"
1305,1306,At Seventeen,Janis Ian,1975,"I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired.
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say come dance with me
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems
At seventeen

A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, ""Pity please the ones who serve,
They only get what they deserve""
The rich relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly

Remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality
And dubious integrity
Their small town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received
At seventeen

To those of us who know the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
And dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me

We all play the game and when we dare
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
That call and say, come dance with me
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me
At seventeen"

Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh!)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)

My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Umm...)
And Dr. Dre said, ""Slim Shady you a basehead!""
Uh-uh! ""Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted!""

Well, since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self, from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off, and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard, I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross

I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser
Chased him with a stapler, stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow-w-w-w!)

Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extra-terrestrial, running over pedestrians
In a spaceship, while they're screamin' at me, ""Let's just be friends!""

Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out, my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her (Oh, thank you!)

You know you blew up when the women rush the stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans (Ahh! Ahhhhh!)

I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive (Huh, yup!)

Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops!)

Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk (Hahh-too)
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How ya gonna breastfeed me, mom?! You ain't got no tits! (Waah, wahh!)

I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang!)
I'm steamin' mad, (Arrhh!) and by the way when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had

Way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart
If you ever need a helping hand
I'll be there on the double
Just as fast as I can

Don't you know that
There ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you

Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough"
1314,1315,Praying For Time,George Michael,1990,"Woah, yeah
Do do do, oh

These are the days of the open hand
They will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers

This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand
With ignorance and legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much
But we'll take our chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score

I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all God's children
Crept out the back door

And it's hard to love
There's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of

And the wounded skies above
Say it's much, much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time

Do, do, do, oh
Mmm, woah yeah

These are the days of the empty hand
Oh you hold on to what you can
And charity
Is a coat you wear twice a year

This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find
That what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much
But I'll take my chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score

And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That He can't come back
'Cause He has no children to come back for

It's hard to love
There's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of

And the wounded skies above
Say it's much too late
So maybe we should all be praying for time
Woah yeah"

Ik weet het nog zo goed
Mijn konijnenhok was leeg
En moeder zij dat ik niet in de schuur mocht komen
En als ik lief ging spelen dat ik dan wat lekkers kreeg

Zij wist ook niet waar Flappie uit kon hangen
Ze zou het papa vragen maar omdat die bezig was
In dat fietsenschuurtje moest ik maar een uurtje
Goed naar Flappie zoeken hij liep vast wel ergens op het gras

Maar ik had het hok toch goed dicht gedaan
Zoals ik dat elke avond deed
Ik was de vorige avond zelfs nog terug gegaan
Ik weet ook niet waarom ik dat deed
Ik had heel lang voor het hok gestaan alsof ik wist 
Wat ik nu weet

Het was eerste kerstdag 1961 wij naar Flappie zoeken vader
Die zocht gewoon mee, bij de bomen en het water
Maar niet in dat fietsenschuurtje, want daar kon die toch niet zitten
En ik schudde nee
We zochten samen, samen tot de koffie de familie aan de koffie, maar ik hoefde niet
Ik dacht aan Flappie en dat het 's nachts zo koud kon vriezen
Mijn hoofdje stil gebogen dikke tranen van verdriet

Want ik had het hok toch goed dicht gedaan
Zo als ik dat elke avond deed 
Ik was de vorige avond zelfs nog terug gegaan
Ik weet ook niet waarom ik dat deed
Ik had heel lang voor het hok gestaan alsof ik wist 
Wat ik nu weet

Het was eerste kerstdag 1961
Er werd luidruchtig gegeten maar dat deed me niet zoveel
Ik dacht aan Flappie, mijn eigen kleine Flappie
Waar zou die lopen, geen hap ging door m'n keel
Toen na de soep het hoofdgerecht moest komen
Sprak mijn vader uiterst grappig kijk Joup daar is Flappie dan
En ik zie de zilveren schaal nog en daar lag ie in 3 stukken
Voor het eerst zag ik mijn vader als een vreselijke man

En ik ben gillend en stampend naar bed gegaan
Heb eerst een uur liggen huilen op de sprei
Nog één keer scheldend boven aan de trap gestaan 
En geschreeuwd Flappie was van mij
Nog heel lang voor het raam gestaan maar het hok stond er maar verlaten bij

Het was tweede kerstdag 1961
Moeder weet dat nog zo goed, vaders bed was leeg
En ik zei dat zij niet in de schuur mocht komen
En als ze lief ging spelen dat ze dan wat lekkers kreeg"

Just a couple hours after dawn
Mrs Hadley peaked out through her curtains
Wondering what was going on
The neighbors said over coffee cups
That nice young couple is breaking up
And in the living room
The linen and the crystals
Sit all packed and set to go
I tell myself once more
I won't be here in spring
To see my roses grow
And all the things you tried to fix
The roof still leaks, the door still sticks
House for sale
You can read it on the sign
House for sale, it was yours and it was mine
And tomorrow some strangers
Will be climbing up the stairs
To the bedroom filled with memories
The one, we used to share
I know you always loved that painting
From that funny little shop in Spain

Remember how we found it
When we ducked in from that sudden summer rain
But I think I keep the silver tray
My mother give us on a wedding day

House for sale
You can read it on the sign
House for sale, it was yours and it was mine
And tomorrow some strangers
Will be climbing up the stairs
To the bedroom filled with memories
The one, we used to share

1323,1324,World Of Hurt,Ilse DeLange,1998,"Day one God smiled,
Gave us all the wisdom of a newborn child
But by the time we take our first step
We've already begun to forget
What the heart knows the heart sees
We're just as much the forest, as we are the trees
Every little seed trying to find
Where the light comes from

And it's a world of hurt, nothing works
It's a lonely little planet made of dust and dirt
Who'd ever think that in the midst of all this
Something as beautiful as love exists
And when I hold you, and you hold me
Heaven doesn't seem like such a mystery
Darling in a world of hurt
You make me feel so good

Day one of our love,
Two heartbroken people scared to trust too much
Oh but here it comes that feelin' again
That every lover swears will never end
We thought we'd been there, done that,
But when we kissed
We knew we'd never been here...
We've never done this
All the walls come tumblin' down
When you love someone"

She was once the girl I used to know for some years

Marian, tell me you still care for me
Marian, remember how good those days used to be
Marian, or don't you agree?

What kind of music fills your head now, my love?
What kind of grapes became your wine?
You tried to find out 'bout your feelings, my love
Were you ever thinking of mine?

There's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time
We let in light and we banish shade

We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time

But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At Christmas time
It's hard, but when you're having fun

There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear
Where the only water flowing
Is the bitter sting of tears

And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom
Well, tonight thank God it's them
Instead of you

And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life (oh)
Where nothing ever grows, no rain nor rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmas time at all? (oh)

(Here's to you) Raise a glass for everyone
(Here's to them) Underneath that burning sun
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

Feed the world
Feed the world
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again

Let them know it's Christmas time again

She got a gun she calls the lucky one

Don't leave a message 'cause this ain't no home

Then she laughed and she laughed, she laughed and she laughed
'Cause she knew she was never comin' back

Man I'm gonna get outta this town
Outta this town and out of L.A.

It's all she loves It's all she hates
It's all too much for her to take
She can't be sure just where it ends
Or where the good life begins

So she took a train, she took a train
To a little old town without a name

She met a man, he took her in
But fed her all the same bullshit again
'Cause he lied and he lied, and he lied and he lied
He lied like a salesman sellin' flies
So she screamed and she screamed, and she screamed and she screamed
It's a different place but the same old thing

It's all I love, it's all I hate
It's all too much for me to take
I can't be sure where it begins
Or if the good life lies within

But she married with a rich man
But the things she wants, he can't do

But I don't seem to matter much to anyone who's around
Is there anybody around

Everynight I walk around the city
Seems like I'll never know
The feeling of being together when I go

And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going
And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going

Everybody knows it's a long way there
Oh, everybody knows it's a long way there
Mmm, it's a long way

Driving around's kind of getting me down and I know, and I know
It's a long long way there
It's such a long long way, long way

Hey, everybody, yeah, don't you feel that there's something
Feel it, feel it
Hey, everybody, yeah, don't you feel that there's something"

That you don't ever want to see me again

But I'm not prepared to go on like this

I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
I can't, I can't, I can't
I can't stand losing you
I can't stand losing you
I can't stand losing you
I can't stand losing you

I see you sent my letters back
And my LP records and they're all scratched
I can't see the point in another day
When nobody listens to a word I say
You can call it lack of confidence
But to carry on living doesn't make no sense

I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing

I guess this is our last goodbye
And you don't care, so I won't cry
But you'll be sorry when I'm dead
And all this guilt will be on your head
I guess you'd call it suicide
But I'm too full to swallow my pride

Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?

Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings, go for a ride

Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

We shall scrimp and save (we shall scrimp and save)

A companion unobtrusive
Plays that song that's so elusive
And the magic music makes your morning mood

Off on your way, hit the open road
There is magic at your fingers
For the spirit ever lingers
Undemanding contact in your happy solitude

Invisible airwaves crackle with life
Bright antennae bristle with the energy
Emotional feedback on a timeless wavelength
Bearing a gift beyond price, almost free

All this machinery making modern music
Can still be open-hearted
Not so coldly charted, it's really just a question
Of your honesty, yeah, your honesty

One likes to believe in the freedom of music
But glittering prizes and endless compromises
Shatter the illusion of integrity, yeah

Invisible airwaves crackle with life
Bright antennae bristle with the energy

Concert hall
And echoes with the sound of salesmen
Of salesmen, of salesmen"

Out of focus

Vluchten kan niet meer, 'k zou niet weten waar naar toe
Hoe ver moet je gaan
De verre landen zijn oorlogslanden
Veiligheidsraadvergaderingslanden, ontbladeringslanden, toeristenstranden
Hoe ver moet je gaan
Vluchten kan niet meer

Zelfs de maan staat vol met kruiwagentjes en op Venus zijn instrumenten
En op aarde zingt de laatste vogel in de laatste lente

Vluchten kan niet meer, 'k zou niet weten waar
Schuilen alleen nog wel, schuilen bij elkaar
Vluchten kan niet meer
Vluchten kan niet meer

Vluchten kan niet meer, heeft geen enkele zin
Vluchten kan niet meer, 'k zou niet weten waarin
Hoe ver moet je gaan
In zaken of werk, of in discipline
In Yin of in Yang of in heroine
In status en auto en geldverdienen
Hoever moet je gaan
Vluchten kan niet meer

Hier in Holland sterft de laatste vlinder op de allerlaatste bloem
En alle muziek die overblijft is de supersonische boem

Vluchten kan niet meer, 'k zou niet weten waar
Schuilen kan nog wel, heel dicht bij elkaar
We maken ons eigen alternatiefje
Met of zonder boterbriefje
M'n liefje, m'n liefje, wat wil je nog meer
Vluchten kan niet meer
Vluchten kan niet meer"

So little time
Try to understand that I'm
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game, I'm
Trying to stay awake and remember my name, but
Everybody's changing, and I don't feel the same

You're gone from here, soon you will disappear, fading into beautiful light
'Cause everybody's changing, and I don't feel right

Show me mercy
From the powers that be

Can someone rescue me?

Absent gods and silent tyranny
We're going under hypnotised
By another puppeteer
And tell me why the men in cloaks
Always have had to bring me down
Running from the ghosts and shadows
The world just disavows, yeah

From the killing machines

Just pour me a drink
And I'll tell you some lies

All the time

Gave you my heart
Gave you my soul

With nothing to hold
Yesterday's gone
Now all I want is a smile

First they say they want you
How they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm
And when they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave, just get away
We all know the song

You need what you need
You can say what you want
Not much you can do
When the feeling is gone
May be blue skies above
But it's cold when your love's on the rocks

First, they say they want you
How they really need you

So gently swaying through the fairy-land of love
If you'll just come with me and see the beauty of

Working, living it brings
Only way to have those things
Toiling has bought too many tears

Op het lichtend pad

Nobody will know that I will never agree

So many will see someday
Will see someday the tears that filled your eyes

But nobody will see me when I get weak inside

One misty morning I'm gonna write your name in the sky
One misty morning I'm gonna write your name in the sky
And after that babe I run away hide myself and cry

Maybe there comes a day that you come walking up to me
Maybe there comes a day that you come walking up to me
That day you know that day I will feel free there

Don't you know that I still love you
Can't you see I'm hiding myself
In my lonely place, in my lonely place"

Has come and gone away
In Paris and Rome

Still feel all alone
I just wanna go home
Oh I miss you, you know

And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
""I'm fine baby, how are you?""
Well I would send them but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that

Another aeroplane
Another sunny place
I'm lucky I know
But I wanna go home
Mmmm, I've got to go home

Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are
I wanna come home

And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not
Come along with me
That this was not your dream
But you always believed in me

Another winter day has come
And gone away
In even Paris and Rome
And I wanna go home
Let me go home

And I'm surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel alone
Oh, let me go home
Oh, I miss you, you know

Let me go home
I've had my run
Baby, I'm done
I gotta go home
Let me go home
It will all be all right
I'll be home tonight
I'm coming back home"

But it's over now

Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely, this air of silence
In the bedroom and all around

Touch me now, I close my eyes
And dream away

It must have been love, but it's over now
It must have been good, but I lost it somehow
It must have been love, but it's over now
From the moment we touched till the time had run out

Make-believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside I turn to water
Like a teardrop in your palm

And it's a hard winter's day
I dream away

It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows

It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It must have been good, but I lost it somehow
It must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
From the moment we touched till the time had run out

Yeah, it must have been love (must have been love) but it's over now (it's over now)
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without

Why...

How many times do I have to try to tell you
That I'm sorry for the things I've done? (ooohhh)
But when I start to try to tell you
That's when you have to tell me
""Hey...this kind of trouble's only just begun."" (yeaah)

I tell myself too many times
""Why don't you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut?""
That's why it hurts so bad to hear the words
That keep on falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth
Tell me

Why...
Why...

I may be mad, I may be blind, I may be viciously unkind
But I can still read what you're thinking (ooohhh)
And I've heard it said too many times
That you'd be better off, besides
Why can't you see this boat is sinking
(This boat is sinking this boat is sinking)
(This boat is sinking this boat is sinking)

Let's go down to the water's edge
And we can cast away those doubts
Some things are better left unsaid
But they still turn me inside out
Turning inside out
Turning inside out

Tell me, why...
Tell me, Why...

This is the book I've never read
These are the words I've never said
This is the path I'll never tread
These are the dreams I'll dream instead
This is the joy that's seldom spread
These are the tears, the tears we shed
This is the fear, this is the dread
These are the contents of my head

And these are the years that we have spent
And this is what they represent
This is how I feel
Do you know how I feel?
'Cause if you think you know
I don't think you know what I feel

I don't think you know what I fear
You don't know what I fear"

We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

Maybe, I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the mornin' rain
As it soaks you to the bone?

Maybe I just wanna fly
Wanna live, I don't wanna die
Maybe I just wanna breathe
Maybe I just don't believe
Maybe you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever
Gonna live forever
Gonna live forever

Gonna live forever!
Gonna live forever!
Gonna live forever!

I've been trying to reach your shore
Waves of doubt keep drowning me

We never fulfilled them
Could be better, should be better
For lessons in love

For restless eyes, egos burn
And the mold is hard to break
Now we've waded in too deep
And love is overboard

Heavy hearts, token words
All the hopes I ever had
Fade like footprints in the sand

All the homes that we were building
We never lived in
Could be better, should be better

If we lose the time before us
The future will ignore us
We should use it, we could use it, yeah

I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone, public excuse me

Been wanting my cake and eat it too, wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew seep it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf

Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Ooh, hit the lottery, oh wee
With what I gave up to get was bittersweet
It was like winning a huge meet

Down yonder and stumbled upon Jeff VanVonderen

Left a clouded mind and a heavy heart
But I am sure we could see a new start

So when your hopes on fire
But you know your desire
Don't hold a glass over the flame
Don't let your heart grow cold
I will call you by name
I will share your road

Hold me fast, Hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
Hold me fast, Hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer

I wrestled long with my youth
We tried so hard to live in the truth
But do not tell me all is fine
When I lose my head, I lose my spine

So leave that click in my head
And I won't remember the words that you said
You brought me out from the cold
Now, how I long, how I long to grow old

So when your hope's on fire
But you know your desire
Don't hold a glass over the flame
Don't let your heart grow cold
I will call you by name
I will share your road

Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching teardrops in my hand

Out across the endless sea
I would die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone

Now bathe my idle soul in

Build a church in the city
A place to crawl with our own

1398,1399,(Something Inside) So Strong,Labi Siffre,1987,"The higher you build your barriers
The taller I become
The farther you take my rights away
The faster I will run
You can deny me
You can decide to turn your face away
No matter, 'cause there's...

Something inside so strong
I know that I can make it
Tho' you're doing me wrong, so wrong
You thought that my pride was gone
Oh no, something inside so strong
Oh oh oh oh oh something inside so strong

The more you refuse to hear my voice
The louder I will sing
You hide behind walls of Jericho
Your lies will come tumbling
Deny my place in time
You squander wealth that's mine
My light will shine so brightly
It will blind you
'Cause there's...

Something inside so strong
I know that I can make it
Tho' you're doing me wrong, so wrong
You thought that my pride was gone
Oh no, something inside so strong
Oh oh oh oh oh something inside so strong

Brothers and sisters
When they insist we're just not good enough
When we know better
Just look 'em in the eyes and say
I'm gonna do it anyway x 4

Something inside so strong
And I know that I can make it
Tho' you're doing me wrong, so wrong
You thought that my pride was gone
Oh no, something inside so strong
Oh oh oh oh oh something inside so strong

Brothers and sisters
When they insist we're just not enough
When we know better
Just look 'em in the eyes and say
I'm gonna do it anyway x 4

Because there's something inside so strong
And I know that I can make it
Tho' you're doing me, so wrong
Oh no, something inside so strong
Oh oh oh oh oh something inside so strong"

I'll be with you when the stars start falling

To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love

I'm with you, my love
The light's shinin' through on you
Yes, I'm with you, my love
It's the morning and just we two

1400,1401,Food For Thought,UB40,1983,"Ivory Madonna, dying in the dust
Waiting for the manna coming from the west
Barren is her bosom, empty as her eyes
Death a certain harvest scattered from the skies

Skin and bones is creeping, doesn't know he's dead
Ancient eyes are peeping, from his infant head
Politicians argue sharpening their knives
Drawing up their bargains, trading baby lives

Ivory Madonna, dying in the dust
Waiting for the manna coming from the west

Hear the bells are ringing, Christmas on it's way
Hear the angels singing, what is that they say?
Eat and drink rejoicing, joy is hear to stay
Jesus son of Mary is born again today"
1401,1402,Let There Be Rock,AC/DC,1977,"In the beginning
Back in 1955
Man didn't know 'bout a rock 'n' roll show
And all that jive

The white man had the schmaltz
The black man had the blues
No one knew what they was gonna do
But Tchaikovsky had the news, he said

Let there be sound, and there was sound
Let there be light, and there was light
Let there be drums, there was drums
Let there be guitar, there was guitar
Let there be rock

And it came to pass
That rock 'n' roll was born
All across the land every rockin' band
Was blowin' up a storm

And the guitar man got famous
The business man got rich
And in every bar there was a superstar
With a seven year itch

There was fifteen million fingers
Learnin' how to play
And you could hear the fingers pickin'
And this is what they had to say

Let there be light, sound, drums, guitar
Oh, let there be rock

One night in a club called the Shakin' Hand
There was a 42 decibel rockin' band
And the music was good and the music was loud
And the singer turned and he said to the crowd:

""Let there be rock"""
1402,1403,One,Johnny Cash,2000,"Is it getting better?
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you, now
You got someone to blame

You said one love, one life
When it's one need, in the night
One love, we get to share it
It leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you?
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well it's, too late, tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to, carry each other, carry each other

One

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

Did I ask too much, more than a lot?
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, and we're doing it again

You said
Love is a temple, love - a higher law
Love is a temple, love - the higher law
You asked me to enter, but then you made me crawl
And I can't be holding on, to what you got
When all you got is hurt

One love, one blood
One life, you've got to do what you should
One life with each other: sisters, brothers
One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other

One

1405,1406,Down On The Corner,Creedence Clearwater Revival,1969,"Early in the evenin', just about supper time
Over by the courthouse, they're startin' to unwind
Four kids on the corner, trying to bring you up
Willy picks a tune out and he blows it on the harp

Down on the corner
Out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet

Rooster hits the washboard and people just got to smile
Blinky thumps the gut bass and solos for a while
Poor Boy twangs the rhythm out, on his Kalamazoo
And Willy goes into a dance, doubles on kazoo

Down on the corner
Out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet

Down on the corner
Out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet

You don't need a penny, just to hang around
But if you've got a nickel, won't you lay your money down
Over on the corner, there's a happy noise
People come from all around to watch the magic boy

Down on the corner
Out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet

Down on the corner
Out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet

If I thought that it would change your mind
But I know that this time
I have said too much, been too unkind

I try to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I try to laugh about it
Hiding my tears in my eyes

'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

I would break down at your feet
And beg forgiveness, plead with you
But I know that it's too late
And now there's nothing I can do

So I try to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I try to laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes

'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

I would tell you that I loved you
If I thought that you would stay
But I know that it's no use
That you've already gone away

Misjudged your limits
Pushed you too far
Took you for granted
I thought that you needed me more, more, more

Now I would do most anything
To get you back by my side
But I just keep on laughing
Hiding my tears in my eyes

'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry
Boys don't cry"

1409,1410,Scenes From An Italian Restaurant,Billy Joel,1977,"A bottle of white, a bottle of red
Perhaps a bottle of rosé instead
We'll get a table near the street
In our old familiar place
You and I, face to face, mmm

A bottle of red, a bottle of white
It all depends upon your appetite
I'll meet you any time you want
In our Italian restaurant

Things are okay with me these days
Got a good job, I got a good office
I got a new wife, got a new life
And the family is fine
Oh, we lost touch long ago
You lost weight, I did not know
You could ever look so nice after so much time

Do you remember those days hanging out at the Village Green?
Engineer boots, leather jackets and tight blue jeans
Oh, you'd drop a dime in the box play a song about New Orleans
Cold beer, hot lights
My sweet romantic teenage nights

Yeah, wooh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Brenda and Eddie were the popular steadies
And the king and the queen at the prom
Riding around with the car top down
And the radio on

Nobody looked any finer
Or was more of a hit at the Parkway Diner
We never knew we could want more than that out of life
Surely Brenda and Eddie would always know how to survive

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Brenda and Eddie were still going steady in the summer of '75
When they decided the marriage would be at the end of July
Everyone said they were crazy
Brenda you know that you're much too lazy
And Eddie could never afford to live that kind of life
Oh, but there we were waving Brenda and Eddie goodbye

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Well, they got an apartment with deep pile carpet
And a couple of paintings from Sears
A big waterbed that they bought with the bread
They had saved for a couple of years
They started to fight when the money got tight
And they just didn't count on the tears, oh, oh

Yeah, rock and roll
Oh, oh, oh

Well they lived for a while in a very nice style
But it's always the same in the end
They got a divorce as a matter of course
And they parted the closest of friends
Then the king and the queen went back to the green
But you can never go back there again, no, oh

Brenda and Eddie had had it already by the summer of '75
From the high to the low to the end of the show
For the rest of their lives
They couldn't go back to the greasers
The best they could do was pick up their pieces
We always knew they would both find a way to get by

Oh, and that's all I heard about Brenda and Eddie
Can't tell you more 'cause I told you already
And here we are waving Brenda and Eddie goodbye

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

A bottle of red, ooh a bottle of white
Whatever kind of mood you're in tonight
I'll meet you anytime you want
In our Italian restaurant"

OKe
Het heeft toch geen enkele zin.
Als je me maar niet ziet als het jochie met de rozen, want dan stort je hele droomwereld in.
Jij was zoals ze dat noemden het materialistische type, maar daar heb je er verrekt weinig meer van.
Je bent nu net zo idealistisch als ik maar, hoe wil je het in godsnaam anders gaan doen?

Ref:
Ben ik te min, ben ik te min omdat je ouders meer poen hebben dan de mijne.
Ben ik te min, ben ik te min omdat je vader een grotere kar rijdt dan de mijne.

En toch wil je blijven, maar je pa die wil het niet. Ik denk dat je beter kunt gaan.
En je moeder die doe je ook veel verdriet. Als je thuis komt zal ze zeggen, wat doe je me aan.
Jou moeder die ik moest aanhoren met haar achterlijke gezeik over de studie van je broer, DOOIE LUL.
En dat je pa zo'n succesvolle zakenman was.
Met andere woorden, wat ben jij een boer.

Ref:
Maar ben ik te min, ben ik te min omdat je ouders meer poen hebben dan de mijne.
Ben ik te min, ben ik te min omdat je vader een grotere kar rijdt dan de mijne.

Maar kijk uit je bent het niet gewend om te vreten van de straat.
Als je lichaamelijk maar net zo erg belangrijk vindt HMMM
Want dan is het in feite niet waar het omgaat.
En als je het aan kunt nou.. kom dan maar gerust weer, en anders dan sodemieter je maar op.
Want het is echt niet dat ik niets om je geef maar zo duw je je hoofd in een strop.

En ben ik te min, ben ik te min omdat je ouders meer poen hebben dan de mijne.
Ben ik te min, ben ik te min omdat je vader een grotere kar rijdt dan de mijne."

But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

You see, man made the cars to take us over the road
Man made the train to carry the heavy load
Man made the electric light to take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water, like Noah made the ark

This is a man's man's man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

Man thinks about a-little bitty baby girls, and a-baby boys
Man make them happy 'cause man make them toys
And after man make everything, everything he can
You know that man makes money to buy from other man

This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing
Not one little thing without a woman or a girl

He's lost in bitterness
He's lost, lost"

Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up, Up and up

Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and up, Up and up

See a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, It's in your blood

Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up, Up and up

We're gonna get it, get it together
I know we're gonna get it, get it together somehow
We're gonna get it, get it together and flower

We're gonna get it, get it together
I know, we're gonna get it, get it together and float
We're gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up, up and up

How come people suffer? How come people part?
How come people struggle? How come people
Break your heart? Break your heart?

Yes I wanna grow, yes I want to feel
Yes I wanna know, show me how to
Heal it up, heal it up

See the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love, Just need love
When the going is rough, saying

We're gonna get it, get it together
I know we're gonna get it, get it together somehow
We're gonna get it, get it together and flower

We're gonna get it, get it together
I know, we're gonna get it, get it together and float
We're gonna get it, get it together and go

And you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind or take a risk
You can say it's mine and clench your fist
Or see each sunrise as a gift

We're gonna get it, get it together
I know we're gonna get it, get it together somehow
We're gonna get it, get it together and flower

We're gonna get it, get it together
I know, we're gonna get it, get it together and float

We're gonna get it, get it together and go

Don't ever give up
Don't ever give up

You pick the insects off plants, no time to think of consequences

Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted

The water is warm but it's sending me shivers
A baby is born crying out for attention
The memories fade like looking through a fogged mirror
Decision to decisions are made and not bought
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot, I guess not

Control yourself, take only what you need from it

It's late September, and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused
But I feel I'm being used
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts

The morning sun, when it's in your face, really shows your age
But that don't worry me none, in my eyes you're everything
I laughed at all of your jokes
My love you didn't need to coax
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without

All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover, you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried

I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand
Oh Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face

You made a first-class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway

Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face

Wanting just to stay awake
Wondering how much I can take, ooh

Should I try to do some more?

Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd change the world for the good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down

When a man loves a woman
He'll spend his very last dime
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be

Well, this man loves you, woman
I gave you everything I have
Tryin' to hold on to your heartless love
Baby, please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playin' him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Lovin' eyes can never see

When a man loves a woman
He can do her no wrong
He can never want some other girl
Yes, when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're my world
When a man loves a woman
Know exactly how he feels
Baby, baby, baby"

Its passion will ride as the cities fly by
And the taillights dissolve in the coming of night
And the questions, in thousands, take flight

My love is a-miles in the waiting
The eyes that just stare and the glance at the clock
And the secret that burns and the pain that grows dark
And it's you once again

Leading me on (Leading me on)
Leading me down the road
Driving beyond (Driving beyond)
Driving me down the road

My love is exceeding the limit
Red-eyed and fevered with the hum of the miles
Distance and longing, my thoughts do collide
Should I rest for a while at the side?

Your love is cradled in knowing
Eyes in the mirror, still expecting they'll come
And sensing too well when the journey is done
There is no turning back, no
There is no turning back, on the run

My love is in league with the freeway
Oh, with the freeway and the coming of nighttime
My love, my love is in league with the freeway"

That the time on the clock was the time I usually retired
To the place where I cleared my head of you
But just for today, I think I'll lie here and dream of you

I've got you under my skin where the rain can't get in
But if the sweat pours out, just shout I'll try to swim and pull you out

A howling wind blows the litter as the rain flows
As street lamps pour orange colored shapes through your window
A broken soul stares from a pair of watering eyes
Uncertain emotions force an uncertain smile

But if the sweat pours out, just shout I'll try to swim and pull you out"

1435,1436,"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother",Hollies,1969,"The road is long
With many a winding turn
That leads us to who knows where
Who knows where
But I'm strong
Strong enough to carry him
He ain't heavy, he's my brother

So on we go
His welfare is of my concern
No burden is he to bear
We'll get there
For I know
He would not encumber me
He ain't heavy, he's my brother

If I'm laden at all
I'm laden with sadness
That everyone's heart
Isn't filled with the gladness
Of love for one another

It's a long, long road
From which there is no return
While we're on the way to there
Why not share?
And the load
Doesn't weigh me down at all
He ain't heavy, he's my brother

He's my brother
He ain't heavy, he's my brother
He ain't heavy, he's my brother"
1436,1437,Working Class Hero,John Lennon,1970,"As soon as you're born, they make you feel small
By giving you no time instead of it all
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all

A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules

A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career
When you can't really function, you're so full of fear

A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV
And you think you're so clever and classless and free
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see

A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

There's room at the top, they are telling you still
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
If you want to be like the folks on the hill

A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

If you want to be a hero, well, just follow me
If you want to be a hero, well, just follow me"

I'm gonna see some folks who have already been let down
I'm so tired of America

I'm gonna make it up for all of The Sunday Times
I'm gonna make it up for all of the nursery rhymes
They never really seem to want to tell the truth
I'm so tired of you, America

Makin' my own way home
Ain't gonna be alone
I got a life to lead, America
I got a life to lead

Tell me do you really think you go to hell for having loved
Tell me enough of thinkin' everything that you've done is good
I really need to know
After soakin' the body of Jesus Christ in blood
I'm so tired of America

I really need to know
I may just never see you again or might as well
You took advantage of a world that loved you well
I'm goin' to a town that has already been burnt down
I'm so tired of you, America

Makin' my own way home
Ain't gonna be alone
I got a life to lead, America
I got a life to lead
I got a soul to feed
I got a dream to heed
And that's all I need

Makin' my own way home
Ain't gonna be alone
I'm goin' to a town
That has already been burnt down"

Ik wenk de barman: Vul de glazen
En denk nog: Jij komt zo meteen
Mensen lachen, mensen praten
Mensen kijken langs me heen

Iemand vraagt me om een vuurtje
Ik schrik op, uit mijn afwezigheid
Ik kijk hem aan en lach een beetje
Ik ben haar kwijt

IS DIT DAN HET EINDE VAN HET FEEST
WIL JIJ DAN SOMS BEWEREN DAT ER NOOIT IETS IS GEWEEST
MAAR WAT JE NIET HEBT GEHAD, RAAK JE OOK NIET KWIJT

Loop ik diezelfde weg alleen
Jij moet hier ook hebben gelopen
Maar wist ik maar waarheen

Het laatste sprankje hoop vervliegt 
Als ik de kamer binnenloop
Jouw hoofd niet op het kussen ligt
Lijkt het bed weer veel te groot
Ik hoor geluiden van de straat
De deur valt in het slot
Is dit het einde?

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah

Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

I want to make you feel beautiful

I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain

With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no-one compares with you (ooh-ooh-ooh)
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new (ooh-ooh-ooh)

For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

1442,1443,'n Vriend,André Hazes,1980,"Jarenlang was jij m'n gabber
Als een broer hield ik van jou
Ik zie je nog daar op de stoep staan
Je stond te rillen van de kou

Zonder huis en zonder centen
Zelfs je vrouw ook die was je kwijt
Ik zei: ""Kom zolang hier wonen""
Maar daarvan heb ik nu spijt

Hielp ik je daarom uit de goot?
Was dan jouw vriendschap niet zo groot?
Hoe vaak lag jij daar in m'n bed?
Zag jij nooit van je vriend aan de muur zijn trouwportret?

Ging er dan echt niets door je heen?
Ben jij zo hard en zo gemeen?
Maar alles is voorbij, je nam haar weg van mij
Het is jammer: onze vriendschap is voorbij

Nooit vroeg ik aan jou een stuiver
Dat je mee-at was gewoon
Zelfs als je een keer wou stappen
Gaf ik jou iets van m'n loon

Gaf je alles, zelfs m'n kleren
Want een vriend die laat je niet staan
Ben je alles dan vergeten?
Waarom deed je mij dit aan?

Hielp ik je daarom uit de goot?
Was dan jouw vriendschap niet zo groot?
Hoe vaak lag jij daar in m'n bed?
Zag jij nooit van je vriend aan de muur zijn trouwportret?

Ging er dan echt niets door je heen?
Ben jij zo hard en zo gemeen?
Maar alles is voorbij, je nam haar weg van mij
Wat een vriend, ja, wat een vriend was jij voor mij

1443,1444,Wat Zou Je Doen,Marco Borsato & Ali B,2004,"Als er nooit meer een morgen zou zijn
En de zon viel in slaap met de maan
Heb je enig idee wat het met je zou doen
Als je nog maar een dag zou bestaan?

Voor sommige kinderen zal er nooit meer een morgen zijn
Hoe zou je 't vinden als je dagen vol zorgen zijn?
Je bent zo jong en klein
Het doet enorm pijn
Het hartje van een kind is zo breekbaar als porselein
Neem nou de tijd om dit even te horen
Want als wij niks doen dan is hun leven verloren
Iedereen heeft het recht op een eerlijk leven
En ze kunnen nog zoveel op deze wereld beleven
Kom, we geven ze een kans en bieden ze hulp
Hou je koppie omhoog en kruip niet in je schulp
Steek de handen in mekaar, want dan staan we sterk
Nee, we kijken niet toe; we gaan aan het werk

Wat zou je doen?
Wat zou ik doen als ik woonde in Bagdad
Wat zou je doen?
Zou ik smeken bij degene die de macht had
Wat zou je doen?
Hee, yo, hoe erg zou het zijn op de Balkan
Wat zou je doen?
De meeste mensen die snappen er geen bal van
Wat zou je doen?
Congo, Kosovo en Pakistan, Sierra Leone
Wat zou je doen?
Sudan en Afghanistan, Eritrea en natuurlijk Georgië
Het is oorlog van hier tot aan Bosnië

Zou je hart zich weer vullen met vuur
Van de eeuwige schaamte bevrijd
Keek je niet meer benauwd naar de klok aan de muur
Kwam je los uit de greep van de tijd
We verbannen de dromen naar morgen en later
Maar doet het je stiekem geen pijn?
Dat je dan pas zou doen wat je altijd al wou
Als er nooit meer een morgen zou zijn?

Je schrikt jezelf rot als je ziet wat gebeurt
Die kleine kip van acht jaar loopt met een mitrailleur
Dit is niet correct, het hoort te spelen met speelgoed
Of voetballen, misschien zijn ze wel heel goed
Hoeveel moet zo'n kind nog lijden?
Iedereen wil toch wel zo'n kind bevrijden?
Bevrijden van de druk en ze horen niet te stressen
De meisjes doen hun best en het worden leraressen
Rappers of zangeressen
Ik hoop dat het lukt
Nou, geef me twee vingers, hou ze hoog in de lucht
Van links naar rechts, hou ze hoog in de lucht
Want de glimlach van een kind is het grootste geluk

Wat zou je doen?
Wat zou ik doen als ik woonde in Bagdad
Wat zou je doen?
Zou ik smeken bij degene die de macht had
Wat zou je doen?
Hee, yo, hoe erg zou het zijn op de Balkan
Wat zou je doen?
De meeste mensen die snappen er geen bal van
Wat zou je doen?
Congo, Kosovo en Pakistan, Sierra Leone
Wat zou je doen?
Sudan en Afghanistan, Eritrea en natuurlijk Georgië
Het is oorlog van hier tot aan Bosnië

Wat zou je doen als er nooit meer een morgen zou zijn?

Wat zou je doen dan?

Wat zou je doen als er nooit meer een morgen zou zijn?

Twee vingers in de lucht, kom op, kom op!

Wat zou je doen als er nooit meer een morgen zou zijn?

War Child, War Child!

Wat zou je doen als er nooit meer een morgen zou zijn?
Wat zou je doen?

War Child!"
1444,1445,Stiekem Gedanst,Toontje Lager,1983,"Ik stond maar wat te drinken wat te hangen
Ik dacht en keek en dacht wat om me heen
Niemand om me even op te vangen
Niemand bijzonder, niemand in het algemeen

Drie uur 's nachts, zeven januari
Het panterbloesje en de spijkerbroek
De armen bloot, de korte zwarte haren
En ik stond daar ergens op een hoek

refr.
Ik heb stiekem met je gedanst
Ik hoop dat je het leuk vond
Ik heb stiekem met je gedanst
Stiekem met je gedanst

Ik denk niet dat je me hebt zien staan kijken
Ik was die jongen met die vage blik
Ik was die jongen die losjes wou lijken
Niet te onschuldig en zeker niet te dik

Ik hebt gedanst zonder te bewegen
Met een gemak zoals je zelden ziet
Misschien kom ik je morgen tegen
Misschien is het wel beter van niet

Ik tel ze op m'n raam
Ik kom niet ver want steeds hoor ik je naam

Het is koud zonder jou
Maar toch blijf ik je trouw

Ik hoef je niet te zeggen dat ik van de hou
Als je in m'n ogen kijk zegt dat genoeg
Moet ik je dan steeds zeggen: ""Schat, ik hou van jou""
Ik gaf je alles wat je mij ook vroeg

Het is stil alleen in huis
Alsjeblieft kom toch weer thuis

Ik hoef je niet te zeggen dat ik van je hou
Als je in m'n ogen kijkt zegt dat genoeg

De avond is gevallen
De lichten zijn al aan
Voor mij ligt al weer een lange nacht

Hoe lang zal dit nog duren?
Mijn ramen die beslaan
Met m'n vinger schrijf ik langzaam je naam

Het is koud zonder jou
Maar toch blijf ik je trouw

Ik hoef je niet te zeggen dat ik van de hou
Als je in m'n ogen kijk zegt dat genoeg
Moet ik je dan steeds zeggen: ""Schat, ik hou van jou""
Ik gaf je alles wat je mij ook vroeg

Totdat hij verhuisde naar een andere stad
Ik heb als ik het goed heb nog een kaart van hem gehad

Een keer trek je de conclusie
Vriendschap is een illusie
Vriendschap is een droom

Ik kreeg toen een vriendin waarmee ik alles deed
Als zij begon te zoenen, dan vree ik met haar mee
Als ik begon te janken, kwam ze naast me staan

En bleek dat ze een ander vriendje had

Als het gaat om vrouwen
Als het gaat om alles wat je lief hebt

This is where the bottle lands
Where all the biggest questions meet
With little feet stood in the sand

This is where the echoes swell to nothing on the tide
And where a tiny pair of hands
Finds a sea-worn piece of glass
And sets it as a sapphire in her mind

And there she stands
Throwing both her arms around the world
The world that doesn't even know
How much it needs this little girl

It's all gonna be magnificent, she says
It's all gonna be magnificent

This is where it all began
To light your mother's cigarette
And to go to touch her hand
And my heart, there defrosting in a gaze
Wasn't built to be that way
Suddenly I understand

There on the sand
Throwing both her arms around the world
The world that doesn't even know
How much it needs this little girl

It's all gonna be magnificent, she says
It's all gonna be magnificent
It's all gonna be magnificent, she says
It's all gonna be magnificent
It's all gonna be magnificent, she says

Where every day's the same, will turn into a long night
Paid too much for losing touch

Because the apathy will crack me up in no time
Because insanity becomes a state of mind
It comes around again
That warning sound can wake me from my sleep
I've gotten into deep

But when you call I'll be ready for the flash
Got too heavy on the dark side
Tumble and fall
I've come a long way to get it back my friend
You took the credit for my lost right
How come it's still going on?

And when the councelling, it doesn't bring the silence
And when the craziness becomes a boring ride
I'll be around again
With every vow you take the best of me
The last thing that I needed

When you call I'll be ready for the flash
Got to heavy on the dark side
Tumble and fall
I've come a long way to get it back my friend
You took the credit for my lost right
How come it's still going on?

The time has come to ditch the agony and make another start
The time is up, I break the line and leave these words behind
Take back what was mine all along

When you call I'll be ready for the flash
Got to heavy on the dark side
Tumble and fall
I've come along way to get it back my friend
You took the credit for my lost right
How come it's still going on?
Way to get it back my friend

1450,1451,Guitar Man,Elvis Presley,1968,"Well, I quit my job down at the car wash
Left my mama a goodbye note
By sundown I'd left Kingston
With my guitar under my coat

I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis
Got a room at the YMCA
For the next three weeks I went huntin' them nightclubs
Lookin' for a place to play

Well, I thought my pickin' would set 'em on fire
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man

Well, I nearly 'bout starved to death down in Memphis
I run outta money and luck
So I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia
On a overloaded poultry truck

I thumbed on down to Panama City
Started pickin' out some of them all night bars
Hopin' I could make myself a dollar
Makin' music on my guitar

I got the same old story at them all night piers
There ain't no room around here for a guitar man
(We don't need a guitar man, son)

So I slept in the hobo jungles
Roamed a thousand miles of track
Till I found myself in Mobile, Alabama
At a club they call Big Jack's

A little four-piece band was jammin'
So I took my guitar and I sat in
I showed 'em what a band would sound like
With a swingin' little guitar man
(Show 'em, son)

If you ever take a trip down to the ocean
Find yourself down around Mobile
Make it on out to a club called Jack's
If you got a little time to kill

Just follow that crowd of people
You'll wind up out on his dance floor
Diggin' the finest little five piece group
Up and down the Gulf of Mexico

Guess who's leadin' that five-piece band
Wouldn't ya know, it's that swingin' little guitar man
Yeah, yeah"

Ik heb jouw liefde: elke nacht slaap jij naast mij
Maar ik ben bang voor elke dag die nog moet komen
Er is geen banger hart, dan dat van mij.

Ik ben niet eens echt op je uiterlijk gevallen
Ook al is er dan geen meid zo mooi als jij
Kijk die manne naar je loeren met z'n allen
Er is geen banger hart dan dat van mij

Ik wil jouw liefde zwart op wit
Ik wil meer zekerheid dan dit
Want jij bent mijn jaloers bezit

Refrein:
Er is geen banger hart, geen banger hart dan dat van mij
't Kan zo niet langer anders keert het zich nog tegen mij
Dan pak je in, zegt: ""jij je zin - nou goed 't is voorbij!""
Geen banger hart, dan dat van mij
Bang, bang hart, bang, bang hart

Ik heb jou liever dan mijn eigenlieve leven
Ik hou van eten, drinken, net zoveel als jij
Er is maar één ding dat ik niet echt in de hand heb:
Er is geen banger hart dan dat van mij

Ik wil jouw liefde zwart op wit
Ik wil meer zekerheid dan dit
Want jij bent mijn jaloers bezit

Refrein

Bang, bang hart, geen banger hart, dan dat van mij

Maar als je bang of eenzaam bent
Wordt ik op slag een ander mens
Ik sla mijn armen om je heen
En kan je troosten als geen
Troosten als geen één!

Er is geen sterker hart, geen sterker hart dan dat van mij
Wanneer jij 'low' bent, ben ik 'high' genoeg voor allebei
Wat wil je dan, ik ben jouw man en alles draait om mij
Ik kan 't aan, laat 't maar slaan, dat bange hart van mij"
1453,1454,What's Love Got To Do With It,Tina Turner,1984,"You must understand
That the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That is only the thrill
Of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract

It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore
That it means more than that

Oh, what's love got to do
Got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do
Got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

It may seem to you
That I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed
I've read it someplace
I've got cause to be

There's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason
You do it for me

Oh, what's love got to do
Got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do
Got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken? Ooh

I've been taking on a new direction
But I have to say
I've been thinking about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way

Oh, what's love got to do
Got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do
Got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

(What's love) got to do
Got to do do with it?
What's love but a sweet old-fashioned notion?
What's love got to do
Got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

(What's love got to do)
Ooh, got to do do with it?
(What's love but a sweet second-hand emotion?)

I'm gonna head downtown
Walk around, settle down,
Find me a proper drink
Don't need a helmet
To get me through life
I walk across the water
Blame it on foolish pride

Lifting me up
Tearing me down
All you give me is indecision
The classic run-around
Bringing me higher
Keeping me whole
Now I feel like I'm living
Living in a Dust Bowl

Diamonds and pearls
You're that kind of girl
You size me up, to break me down
While you're sipping on your crown royal
I'll give you shelter
Babe, it's your call
It's hard to find truth within
When you're living in your own zone

Lifting me up
Tearing me down
All you give me is indecision
The classic run-around
Bringing me higher
Keeping me whole
Now I feel like I'm living
Living in a Dust Bowl

Pride and deception
The same kind of pain
And all that's left for me to lose
Is meant for you to gain
Playing it close
Stealing your time
But who cares anyway?
Ive gone the extra mile

Lifting me up
Tearing me down
All you give me is indecision
The classic run-around
Bringing me higher
Keeping me whole
Now I feel like I'm living
Living in a Dust Bowl

Clouds got in the way
We gave it up in a moment of madness
And threw it all away

Don't answer me
Don't break the silence, don't let me win
Don't answer me
Stay on your island, don't let me in
Run away and hide from everyone
Can you change the things we've said and done?

It's all a fantasy
So if you need to believe in someone
Just pretend it's me
It ain't enough that we meet as strangers
I can't set you free
So will you turn your back forever
On what you mean to me?

Still I have no regrets
Just like you, I was such a rebel

Why do you sing only harmony
Cause down on the street something's going on
There's a brand new beat and a brand new song

In my heart, there's a young girl's passion
For a life long duet
And someday soon, someone's smile will haunt you

But I will go down with this ship

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand
And lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something
To make you change your mind

Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags?
She's no time for talking, she just keeps right on walking
Carrying her home in two carrier bags

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand
And lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something
To make you change your mind

In the all night café at a quarter past eleven
Same old man sitting there on his own
Looking at the world over the rim of his teacup
Each tea lasts an hour, and he wanders home alone

So how can you tell me you're lonely
Don't say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand
And lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something
To make you change your mind

Have you seen the old man outside the seaman's mission
Memory fading with the metal ribbons that he wears?
In our winter city the rain cries a little pity
For one more forgotten hero and a world that doesn't care

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine

Oh you'll never see my shade or hear the sound of my feet

It was many years ago that I became what I am
I was trapped in this life like an innocent lamb
Now I can never show my face at noon
And you'll only see me walking by the light of the moon
The brim of my hat hides the eye of a beast
I've the face of a sinner but the hands of a priest
Oh you'll never see my shade or hear the sound of my feet
While there's a moon over Bourbon Street

She walks everyday through the streets of New Orleans
She's innocent and young from a family of means
I have stood many times outside her window at night
To struggle with my instinct in the pale moonlight
How could I be this way when I pray to God above
I must love what I destroy and destroy the thing I love

In New Orleans, I was
Down and out
He looked to me to be the very eyes of age
As the smoke ran out
Talked of life, lord that man talked of life
Laughed, clicked his heels and stepped

He said his name was ""Bojangles""
And he danced a lick
Right across the cell
He grabbed his pants
Took a bitter stance
Jumped up high
That's when he
Clicked his heels
Then he let go a laugh
Lord, he'd let go a laugh
Shook back his clothes all around

Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Dance

He told me of the times
He worked with minstrel shows
Throughout the south
He spoke with tears
Of fifteen years
How his dog and he
They travel all about
The dog up and died
Dog up and died
And after twenty years he still grieved

He said ""I dance
Now and every chance a
Honkey-tonk
For drinks and tips.
But most of the time
I spend behind these country bars
You see son, I drinks a bit.""
He shook his head
As he shook his head
I heard someone
Say please, please, please

A-Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles

Would change his life forever?

With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid
Of the things he's feeling

He could just be gone
He would just sail on
He'll just sail on

If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?

How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive?
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

These days drift on inside a fog
It's thick and suffocating
This sinking life, outside it's hell
Inside intoxicating

He's run aground like his life
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast, down with his ship
Fading in the shadows

Now a castaway
They've all gone away
They've gone away

Searched for seas of gold

So far from the stars

The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

If the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth

Everything comes back to you

I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he's got his arms around you

It's so hard
So hard

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

Them butterflies they come alive when I'm next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

That I can't move on
But there's something about you
If the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you

Maybe he's in love

Life can be so cruel
I don't know what to do

I've been there
With my heart out in my hand
But what you must understand
You can't let the chance
To love him pass you by

Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon rise in his eyes
Reach out to him

And whisper
Tender words so soft and sweet
I'll hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

The truth will set you free
You'll have what's meant to be
All in time, you'll see

Of that much I can be sure (Hold him close to you)
I don't think I could endure
If I let him walk away
When I have so much to say

Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon rise in his eyes
Reach out to him

And whisper
Tender words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

Love is light that surely glows
In the hearts of those who know
It's a steady flame that grows

Feed the fire with all the passion you can show

Tonight love will assume its place

This memory time cannot erase

Your faith will lead love where it has to go

Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon rise in his eyes
Reach out to him

And whisper (Ohoho!)
Whisper words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

Never let him go"

When she told us where she came from.
There was a flash in the sky
A light in her eye
And the dynamite light burned on.

Looking out windows,

Prepare yourself to go,
Waterloo station,
Bought a '69 Capri,
Failed the M.O.T.,
What a waste of time,
The Worker, the worker,
The worker, the worker.
Always kiss the wife goodbye,
Often wonder why,
At seven in the morning?
Think it's time for a change,
Wouldn't that be strange,
What a waste of time.

1489,1490,La Solitudine,Laura Pausini,1993,"Marco se n'è andato e non ritorna più
Il treno delle sette e trenta senza lui
È un cuore di metallo senza l'anima
Nel freddo del mattino grigio di città

A scuola il banco è vuoto, Marco è dentro me
È dolce il suo respiro fra i pensieri miei
Distanze enormi sembrano dividerci
Ma il cuore batte forte dentro me

Chissà se tu mi penserai
Se con i tuoi non parli mai
Se ti nascondi come me
Sfuggi gli sguardi e te ne stai

Rinchiuso in camera e non vuoi mangiare
Stringi forte al te il cuscino
Piangi non lo sai
Quanto altro male ti farà la solitudine

Marco nel mio diario ho una fotografia
Hai occhi d'un bambino un poco timido
La stringo forte al cuore e sento che ci sei
Fra i compiti d'inglese e matematica

Tuo padre e i suoi consigli, che monotonia
Lui con il suo lavoro ti ha portato via
Di certo il tuo parere non l'ha chiesto mai
Ha detto: ""un giorno tu mi capirai""

Chissà se tu mi penserai
Se con gli amici parlerai
Per non soffrire più per me
Ma non è facile lo sai

A scuola non me posso più
E i pomeriggi senza te
Studiare è inutile tutte le idee
Si affollano su te

Non è possibile dividere
La vita di noi due
Ti prego aspettami, amore mio
Ma illuderti non so

La solitudine fra noi
Questo silenzio dentro me
È l'inquietudine di vivere
La vita senza te

Ti prego aspettami perché
Non posso stare senza te
Non è possibile dividere
La storia di noi due

Questo silenzio dentro me
È l'inquietudine di vivere
La vita senza te

Ti prego aspettami perché
Non posso stare senza te

As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth, we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky

You're a shooting star, I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright, tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond (oh)
Shine bright like a diamond (oh)
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond (oh)
Shine bright like a diamond (oh)
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

So shine bright, tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive

1492,1493,I Sat By The Ocean,Queens Of The Stone Age,2013,"I sat by the ocean
And drank a potion, baby, to erase you
Face down in the boulevard, yet I couldn't face you
There ain't no use in crying
It doesn't change anything, so baby, what good does it do?
Your friends they all sympathize, maybe I don't need them to

Imagine I'd be your one and only
Instead I'm the lonely one

You, me
And a lie
Silence is closer
We're passing ships in the night

There's nowhere to run away
Said, ""Boy if you want love, you'll have to go
And find it with someone new""
""Do you know who you really are, are you sure it's really you?""
Lies are a funny thing
They slip through your fingertips because they never happened to you
Time wounds all the heals as we fade out of view

Imagine I'd be your one and only
Instead I'm the lonely one

You, me
And a lie
Silence is closer
We're passing ships in the night

You, me
And a lie
Silence is closer
We're passing ships in the night

Into the light
Left with nowhere to hide

Closer and closer
We're crashing ships in the night"
1493,1494,Beautiful Goodbye,Amanda Marshall,1996,"I'm fed up with my destiny
And this place of no return
I think I'll take another day
And slowly watch it burn
And it doesn't really matter
How the time goes by
'Cause I still remember you and I
And that beautiful goodbye

We staggered through these empty streets
Laughing arm in arm
The night had made a mess of me
Your confessions kept me warm
I don't really miss you, I just need to know
Do you ever think of you and I
And that beautiful goodbye

When I see you now
I wonder how
I could've watched you walk away
If I let you down
Please forgive me now
For that beautiful goodbye

In these days of no regrets
I keep mine to myself
And all the things we never said
I can save for someone else
And nothing lasts forever
But we always try
And I just can't help but wonder why
We let it pass us by, yeah

When I see you now
I wonder how
I could've watched you walk away
If I let you down
Please forgive me now
For that beautiful goodbye

Baby, what can I do
Oh, to get through to you
And sometimes I cry, yeah
It's a fool's lullaby
Sometimes I cry
It's just a fool's lullaby
I'm dying inside"

And you play it coy
But it's kinda cute
Oh when you smile at me
You know exactly what you do
Baby don't pretend
That you don't know it's true
'Cause you can see it
When I look at you

And in this crazy life
And through these crazy times
It's you, it's you
You make me sing
You're every line
You're every word
You're everything

You're a carousel
You're a wishing well
And you light me up
When you ring my bell
You're a mystery
You're from outer space
You're every minute of my every day
And I can't believe
That I'm your man
And I get to kiss you baby
Just because I can
Whatever comes our way
We'll see it through
And you know
That's what our love can do

And in this crazy life
And through these crazy times
It's you, it's you
You make me sing
You're every line
You're every word
You're everything

Inside my chest to keep me up at night
Dream of ways
To make you understand my pain

Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare

If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?

Drop his name
Push it in and twist the knife again
Watch my face
As I pretend to feel no pain

Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare

If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
Just say so

How come the only way to know how high you get me
Is to see how far I fall?
God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me
But I can't break through it all
It's a heart, heartbreak

I don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight
Let's just fix this whole thing now
I swear to God we're gonna get it right
If you lay your weapon down

Red wine and Ambien
You're talking shit again
It's heartbreak warfare
Good to know it's all a game
Disappointment has a name

It's heartbreak
It's heartbreak warfare
It's heartbreak warfare"

This love won't let me go

So long

Angel of Harlem, yeah

She says it's heart, heart and soul
Yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah, right now

Blue light on the avenue
God knows they got to you
An empty glass, the lady sings
Eyes swollen like a bee sting

Blinded, you lost your way
Through the side streets and the alleyway
Like a star exploding in the night
Falling to the city in broad daylight

An angel in Devil's shoes
Salvation in the blues
You never looked like an angel
Yeah yeah, angel of Harlem

Angel, angel of Harlem
Angel, angel of Harlem
Angel, angel of Harlem

It's early to rise, early in the sack
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well, the simple kind of life never did me no harm
A raisin' me a family and workin' on the farm
My days are all filled with an easy country charm
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's comin' up, I got cakes on the griddle
And life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy

When the work's all done and the sun's settin' low
I pull out my fiddle and I rosin up the bow
The kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low
Thank God I'm a country boy

I'd play ""Sally Goodin"" all day if I could
But the Lord and my wife wouldn't think it very good
So I fiddle when I can and I work when I should
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's comin' up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle

Well, I wouldn't trade my life for diamonds or jewels
I never was one of them money hungry fools
I'd rather have my fiddle and my farmin' tools
Thank God I'm a country boy

Yeah, city folk drivin' in a black limousine
A lotta sad people thinkin' ""thatsa mighty keen!""
Well son, let me tell you now exactly what I mean
I thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's comin' up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well, my fiddle was my daddy's till the day he died
And he took me by the hand, held me close to his side
Said, ""Live a good life, play my fiddle with pride,
Thank God you're a country boy""

Well, my daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle
Taught me how to work and play a tune on the fiddle
He taught me how to love and how to give just a little
And thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's comin' up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle

je bent zoveel veranderd
ik werd niet wat jij wou maar pappa luister nou
ik doe de dingen die ik doe met mun ogen dicht

jij was heel wat van plan maar daar kwam weinig van
ik lever geen prestaties
ik heb niet veel geleerd deed alles net verkeerd
heb moeite met relaties
ik loop niet in de rij ik breek en vecht me vrij
en doe de dingen die ik doe met mun ogen dicht

knoop je jas dicht doe un das om was eerst je handen
kam je haren recht je schouders denk aan je tanden
blijf niet hangen recht naar huis toe spreek met twee woorden
stel je netjes voor eet zoals ut hoort en zeg u

ik sta hier en ik zing ik doe gewoon mun ding
dat moet je accepteren
ach luister nou toch pa het is nog niet te laat
want leven kun je leren
ik weet niet waar ik sta loop niemand achterna
maar doe de dingen die ik doe met mun ogen dicht

knoop je jas dicht doe een das om was eerst je handen
kam je haren recht je schouders denk aan je tanden

1506,1507,You Have Been Loved,George Michael,1997,"She takes the back road and the lane
Past the school that has not changed
In all this time
She thinks of when the boy was young
All the battles she had won
Just to give him life

That man
She loved that man
For all his life
But now we meet to take him flowers
And only God knows why

For what's the use in pressing palms
When children fade in mother's arms
It's a cruel world
We've so much to lose
And what we have to learn we rarely choose

So if it's God who took her son
He cannot be the one living in her mind

Take care my love, she said
Don't think that God is dead
Take care my love, she said

You have been loved

If I was weak, forgive me
But I was terrified
You brushed my eyes with angels wings, full of love
The kind that makes devils cry

So these days
My life has changed
And I'll be fine
But she just sits and counts the hours
Searching for her crime

So what's the use of pressing palms
If you won't keep such love from harm
It's a cruel world
You've so much to prove
And heaven helps the ones who wait for you

Well I've no daughters, I've no sons
Guess I'm the only one
Living in my life

Take care my love, he said
Don't think that God is dead
Take care my love, he said

Niet meer weet wat ik moet doen
Dan drink ik veel dan wordt het laat
Dan wil ik dat je voor me staat
Ik vertel je dat het niet meer gaat
En dan geef je mij een zoen

Een mooi liedje

Ik rook
Mijn laatste peuk weg
En daarna moet ik naar bed
Om na een uur weer op te staan
Om weer naar buiten toe te gaan
Dat ik ons dit heb aangedaan
Ik hoop dat jij je redt
En dan zing ik

Een mooi liedje
Mooi liedje
Mooi liedje voor jou

Vannacht
Als ik alleen ben
Wanneer ik huil om jou
Dan drink ik veel vervagen dingen
Niet in staat me te bedwingen
Wil ik alleen mijn pijn bezingen
En daarom zing ik nou

Een mooi liedje voor jou"
1514,1515,Sing For Absolution,Muse,2003,"Lips are turning blue
A kiss that can't renew
I only dream of you
My beautiful

Tiptoe to your room
A starlight in the gloom
I only dream of you
And you never knew

Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace

There's no where left to hide
In no one to confide
The truth burns deep inside
And will never die

Lips are turning blue
A kiss that can't renew
I only dream of you
My beautiful

Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace

Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace

Our wrongs remain unrectified
And our souls
Won't be exhumed"

1516,1517,Are You Lonesome Tonight,Elvis Presley,1961,"Are you lonesome tonight?
Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray
To a bright summer day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?

Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain?
Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know, someone said that the world's a stage
And each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
Act one was when we met
I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two
You seemed to change, you acted strange
And why I've never known

Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you

Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down

Is your heart filled with pain?
Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?"
1517,1518,Still Crazy After All These Years,Paul Simon,1975,"I met my old lover
On the street last night
She seemed so glad to see me
I just smiled
And we talked about some old times
And we drank ourselves some beers
Still crazy after all these years
Still crazy after all these years

I'm not the kind of man
Who tends to socialize
I seem to lean on
Old familiar ways
And I ain't no fool for love songs
That whisper in my ears
Still crazy after all these years
Still crazy after all these years

Four in the morning
Crapped out
Yawning
Longing my life away
I'll never worry
Why should I?
It's all gonna fade

Now I sit by my window
And I watch the cars
I fear I'll do some damage
One fine day
But I would not be convicted
By a jury of my peers
Still crazy after all these years
Still crazy
Still crazy
Still crazy after all these years"

You're takin' me home
You say you wanna stay
I say I wanna be alone
I say I don't love you
But you know I'm a liar
'Cause when we kiss
Ooh, fire

Right from the start
A grip so tight
I couldn't tear it apart

Actin' like a fool

But my heart stays cool

Well, Romeo and Juliet

Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

And maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your
Sweet love hasn't died
And give me
Give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
Keep you satisfied

Little things I should have
Said and done
I just never took the time

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind"

1522,1523,Can You Feel The Love Tonight,Elton John,1994,"There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of the rolling world can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer, that we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds, believe the very best

There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer, that we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds, believe the very best
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds, believe the very best"
1523,1524,Waarom Nou Jij,Marco Borsato,1994,"Als er iemand bij me wegging
Even slikken en weer doorgaan
Even woelen en gewoon weer opstaan
Het deed me weinig

Maar om jou ben ik verdrietig
Zonder jou ontzettend nietig
Je stem die in mijn hoofd blijft zitten
Mij geen moment met rust laat

En dat er mensen zijn die lachen
En dat er mensen zijn die dansen
En dat er mensen zijn die innig zoenen
Dat kan ik nu niet meer begrijpen

Ik voel alleen de pijn van 'God, waar is ze?'
Ik voel alleen de pijn van jou hier bij me missen
En ik kan er niet mee omgaan
Ik kan er echt niet meer mee omgaan

En ik zou wel willen smeken
Je op m'n knieën willen smeken
Als ik wist dat dat nog zin had
Maar de dagen worden weken en de weken worden jaren

Dit gevecht kan ik niet winnen
Want jij zit veel te diep vanbinnen
Waarom nou jij, waarom nou jij?
Waarom nou jij?

Waarom ben jij hier uit m'n leven?
Waarom ben jij nou niet gebleven?
Waarom wou jij me niets meer geven?
Waarom ben jij vertrokken zonder reden?

Ik hou je vast in mijn gedachte
Ik zie nog hoe je naar me lachte
Ik mis je lippen op de mijne
Een beeld dat nooit meer zal verdwijnen
Jouw hand niet meer in de mijne

Dus tel ik de lege lange dagen
Die zonder jou voorbijgaan
Met geen enkele hoop voor morgen
Geen hoop op wat dan ook

Maar jij
Zul je soms nog aan me denken?
Ben ik soms nog een beetje bij je?

'k Tel gewoon de lange dagen
'k Tel gewoon de lege lange dagen
Maar ik wil niet
Ik wil niet meer

Even woelen en gewoon weer opstaan

In a world I hadn't seen
When I'm feeling ordinary
When I don't know what I mean

Oh I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
For the thirst and for the hunger
Come the conference of birds

Saying it's true, it's not what it seems
Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams
And you get a head, a head full of dreams
You can see the change you wanted
Be what you want to be
And you get a head, a head full of dreams
Into life I've just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

Oh I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
When you got me open-handed
When you got me lost for words
I sing oh-oh-oh

A head full of dreams
A head full of dreams
Into life I've just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams"
1526,1527,Mushanga,Toto,1988,"I can't forget you my little Mushanga
I keep a place in my heart for you
The days of waiting they keep getting longer
And not a thing I can do
I was a poet, a magazine writer
Sent to report on political views
It was by chance through a lens that I met you
A Cape Town girl with no shoes

You were runnin' down the road
I was going your way
I stopped and turned around to lent you my hand
You smiled though you were suffering
I didn't understand, then

You broke into my heart
I saw your eyes and then I knew
You broke into my heart
Like the wind and rain that followed you
You broke into my heart
Had the Lord above forgotten you?
You broke in from the start
And all my tears belong to you

Mushanga, oh, Mushanga, oh

I sat and watched as she danced by the fires
Through ancient songs did the tale unfold
They sang of diamonds that came from their mountains
The loss of lives mining white man's gold

I had to leave and go back to Manhattan
Where all my stories are bought and sold
I know the city would surely be saddened
If what I knew could be told

You were runnin' down the road
I was going your way
I stopped and turned around to lent you my hand
You smiled though you were suffering
I didn't understand, then

It's been so long since I last heard your laughter
So many letters and still no news
I hope you find all the things that you're after
You know my heart is with you

You were runnin' down the road
I was going your way
I stopped and turned around to lent you my hand
You smiled though you were suffering
I didn't understand, then

You broke into my heart
I saw your eyes and then I knew
You broke into my heart
Like the wind and rain that followed you
You broke into my heart
Had the Lord above forgotten you?
You broke into my heart
I saw your eyes and then I knew

You broke in from the start

Want daar is de blauwe lucht

Sammy loop niet zo verlegen
Zo verlegen door de regen
Waarom loop je zo verlegen Sammy
Door de stegen Sammy van de stad
Hoog Sammy, kijk omhoog Sammy
Want dan word je lekker nat

Op een wondertje te wachten

1528,1529,Close To The Edge,Yes,1972,"I. The Solid Time of Change

A seasoned witch could call you from the depths of your disgrace
And rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace
And achieve it all with music that came quickly from afar
And taste the fruit of man recorded losing all against the hour

And assessing points to nowhere, leading every single one
A dewdrop can exalt us like the music of the sun
And take away the plain in which we move
And choose the course you're running

Down at the end, round by the corner
Not right away, not right away
Close to the edge, down by a river
Not right away, not right away

Crossed the line around the changes of the summer
Reaching out to call the color of the sky
Passed around a moment clothed in mornings faster than we see

Getting over all the time I had to worry
Leaving all the changes far from far behind
We relieve the tension only to find out the master's name

Down at the end, round by the corner
Close to the edge, just by the river
Seasons will pass you by
I get up, I get down

Now that it's all over and done
Now that you find, now that you're whole

II. Total Mass Retain

My eyes convinced, eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love
It changed as almost strained amidst clear manna from above
I crucified my hate and held the word within my hand
There's you, the time, the logic, or the reasons we don't understand

Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see
As armored movers took approached to overlook the sea
There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be

Down at the edge, close by a river
Close to the end, round by the corner

Close to the end, down by the corner
Down at the edge, round by a river

Sudden cause shouldn't take away the startled memory
All in all, the journey takes you all the way
As apart from any reality that you've ever seen and known

Guessing problems only to deceive the mention
Passing paths that climb halfway into the void
As we cross from side to side, we hear the total mass retain

Down at the end, round by the corner
Close to the edge, just by the river
Seasons will pass you by
I get up, I get down

III. I Get Up, I Get Down

In her white lace, you could clearly see the lady sadly looking
Saying that she'd take the blame for the crucifixion of her own domain

I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down

Two million people barely satisfy
Two hundred women watch one woman cry, too late

The eyes of honesty can achieve
(She would gladly say it amazement of her story)
How many millions do we deceive each day?
(Asking only interest could be laid upon the children of her domain)

I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down

In charge of who is there in charge of me
(She could clearly see the lady sadly looking)
Do I look on blindly and say I see the way?
(Saying that she'd take the blame for the crucifixion of her own domain)

The truth is written all along the page
(She would gladly say it amazement of her story)
How old will I be before I come of age for you?
(Asking only interest could be laid upon the children of her domain)

I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down

I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down

IV. Seasons of Man

The time between the notes relates the color to the scenes
A constant vogue of triumphs dislocate man, so it seems
And space between the focus shape ascend knowledge of love
As song and chance develop time, lost social temperance rules above
Ah, ah

Then according to the man who showed his outstretched arm to space
He turned around and pointed, revealing all the human race
I shook my head and smiled a whisper, knowing all about the place

On the hill we viewed the silence of the valley
Called to witness cycles only of the past
And we reach all this with movements in between the said remark

Close to the edge, down by the corner
Down at the end, round by a river
Seasons will pass you by

Now that it's all over and done
Called to the seed, right to the sun
Now that you find, now that you're whole

Seasons will pass you by
I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down"

Their angry words sound clear thru these thin walls
Around midnight I heard him shout unfaithful woman
And I knew right there the axe was gonna fall

It's because of me
It's because of me

I heard him shout who is he, she mumbled low
He said baby don't you lie to me no more
And I'm listening thru these thin walls, silent and shamed
As she called out my name I was right next door

It's because of me
It's because of me
Because of me
It's because of me

She was right next door and I'm such a strong persuader
That she was just another notch on my guitar
She's gonna lose the man that really loves her
In the silence I can hear their breaking hearts

At daybreak I hear him pack and say goodbye
I can hear him slam the door and walk away
Right next door I hear that woman start to cry
I should go to her but what would I say

It's because of me
It's because of me
Because of me

All together but we're so alone.
Staring out through a wall of glass,
Look away because it's gonna crash.

And ooh...
My hart is open.
Ooh, the times are changing.

Forever.

Put a picture in a golden frame,
But in the end it will be the same.

Chains are broken and my eyes are wide,
It feels so good, just to be alive.

And ooh...
My hart is open.

Ooh, the times are changing.
Forever.
Forever.

I could wait until the day I die,
For something real that I can't deny.

Gonna give myself a fighting chance,
And find somebody who understands.

In the heat of the neon
The quiet in the cool night air
Makes it easy to breathe
The music that we hear in our heats
Gives us something to dream of
'Cause when that lonely soul that calls
It's those dreams that we'll need
To keep us strong
To take us far
Far away from the pain of the days
Cause that's a cruel mental start

And if I should ever again cross your mind

Steht sie da
Und wartet auf den Start. -
Alles klar

Experten streiten sich
Um ein paar Daten -
Die Crew hat dann noch
Ein paar Fragen, doch
Der Countdown läuft

Effektivität
Bestimmt das Handeln
Man verlässt sich blind
Auf den andern

Jeder weiss genau
Was von ihm abhängt
Jeder ist im Stress
Doch Major Tom
Macht einen Scherz

Dann hebt er ab und!...

...Völlig losgelöst
Von der Erde
Schwebt das Raumschiff
Völlig schwerelos

Die Erdanziehungskraft
Ist überwunden
Alles läuft perfekt -
Schon seit Stunden

Wissenschaftliche
Experimente
Doch was nützen die
Am Ende
Denkt sich Major Tom

Im Kontrollzentrum
Da wird man panisch
Der Kurs der Kapsel der
Stimmt ja gar nicht

""Hallo Major Tom
Können Sie hören
Woll'n Sie das Projekt
Denn so zerstören?""
Doch, er kann nichts hörn'
Er schwebt weiter...

...Völlig losgelöst
Von der Erde
Schwebt das Raumschiff
Völlig schwerelos

Die Erde schimmert blau
Sein letzter Funk kommt:
""Grüsst mir meine Frau!""
Und er verstummt

Unten trauern noch
Die Egoisten
Major Tom denkt sich
""Wenn die wüssten -
Mich führt hier ein Licht
Durch das All
Das kennt ihr noch nicht
Ich komme bald
Mir wird kalt.""

1559,1560,The Jean Genie,David Bowie,1973,"A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go and everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie, woohoo

The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go

Sits like a man, but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie, woohoo

The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go

He's so simple minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved
Loves to be loved

The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go

Go
Go

The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks

The Jean Genie, let yourself go

Go
Go, go"

All the way across town
'Cause you've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself

Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roaming for the moment, sleazing my backyard, so don't get
So uptight you've been thinking about ditching me

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right

So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

Woo

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found

Sent to meetings, hypnotized
Overexposed, commercialized
Handle me with care

Just try to make it work
To feel the fear before you're here
I make the shapes come much too close
I pull my eyes out, hold my breath and wait
Until I shake

But if I had your faith
Then I could make it safe and clean
If only I was sure
That my head on the door was a dream

1568,1569,She's Leaving Home,Beatles,1967,"Wednesday morning at five o'clock
As the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen
Clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the back door key
Stepping outside she is free

She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye bye)
For so many years

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
""Daddy, our baby's gone""
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?

She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye bye)
For so many years

Friday morning at nine o'clock
She is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

She (What did we do that was wrong?)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied (Bye bye)
For so many years

She's leaving home
Bye bye"

Of the smiles we left behind

For the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line?
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

May be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply to choose to forget

So it's the laughter
We will remember
Whenever we remember

And our bodies will change

As we are

We'll still sing our song
When our hair ain't so blonde
And our children have sung
We were right

They'll sing
Grow old with me

And all the best it could be

And the hairs they stand up
And my feet start to thump
Yet the feeling is dreaming
Around

Make me feel like I'm real

Come on, throw your hands up
If you've got the feeling
Jump up touch the ceiling

Muggs lifts a funk flow
Someone's talking junk, yo
I'll bust him in the eye
And then I'll take the punk's hoe

Feelin', funkin'
Amps in the trunk, and
I got more rhymes than there's cops at a Dunkin' Donuts shop
Sho' 'nuff I got props from the kids on the hill
Plus my mom and my pops

I came to get down

Jump around, jump around, jump around
Jump up, jump up and get down
Jump, jump, jump (everybody jump)
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump (everybody jump)
Jump, jump, jump, jump

I'll serve your ass like John MacEnroe
If your girl steps up, I'm smacking the hoe

Word to your moms
I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms

And just like the Prodigal Son, I've returned
Anyone stepping on me - you'll get burned
'Cause I got lyrics but you ain't got none
If you come to battle bring a shotgun (shotgun)

But if you do you're a fool, 'cause I duel to the death
Tryin' to step to me - you'll take your last breath
I got the skill, come get your fill
'Cause when I shoot to give, I shoot to kill

I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig 'cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a Terminator
Like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Tryin' to play me out as if my name was Sega

But I ain't going out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style and you know I might switch
It up up and around, then buck buck get down
Put out your head then you wake up in the Dawn Of The Dead

I'm coming to get ya, I'm coming to get ya
Spitting out lyrics, homie I'll wet ya

Birds and snakes, an aeroplane
Lenny Bruce is not afraid

Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn
World serves its own needs, don't misserve your own needs
Feed it up a knock, speed, grunt no, strength no
Ladder structure clatter with fear of height, down height
Wire in a fire, represent the seven games
In a government for hire and a combat site
Left her, wasn't coming in a hurry with the furies
Breathing down your neck

Team by team reporters baffled, trump, tethered crop
Look at that low plane! Fine, then
Uh-oh, overflow, population, common group
But it'll do. Save yourself, serve yourself
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed
Tell me with the rapture and the reverent in the right - right
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam, fight, bright light
Feeling pretty psyched

It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine

Six o'clock - TV hour. Don't get caught in foreign tower
Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn
Lock him in uniform and book burning, blood letting
Every motive escalate. Automotive incinerate
Light a candle, light a motive. Step down, step down
Watch a heel crush, crush. Uh-oh
This means no fear - cavalier. Renegade and steer clear!
A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives and I decline

It's the end of the world as we know it
(It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it

Mountains sit in a line. Leonard Bernstein
Leonid Brezhnev, Lenny Bruce, and Lester Bangs
Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, boom!
You symbiotic, patriotic, slam, but neck, right? Right

It's the end of the world as we know it

This is where I long to be

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo 'te amo'

They went so fast

When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song

I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him and listen for a while
And there he was this young boy
A stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song

I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song...

He sang as if he knew me
In all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there
And he just kept on singing
Singing clear and strong

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly

He was strumming my pain
Yeah he was singing my life
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song"
1596,1597,Brilliant Disguise,Bruce Springsteen,1987,"I hold you in my arms
As the band plays
What are those words whispered, baby
Just as you turn away

I saw you last night
Out on the edge of town
I want to read your mind to know
Just what I've got in this new thing I've found

So tell me what I see
When I look in your eyes
Is that you, baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

I heard somebody call your name
From underneath our willow
I saw something tucked in shame
Underneath your pillow

Well, I've tried so hard baby
But I just can't see
Oh, what a woman like you
Is doing with me

So tell me who I see
When I look in your eyes
Is that you, baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

Now look at me, baby
Struggling to do everything right
And then it all falls apart
Oh, when out go the lights

I'm just a lonely pilgrim
I walk this world in wealth
I want to know if it's you I don't trust
'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself

Now, you play the loving woman
I'll play the faithful man
But just don't look too close
Into the palm of my hand

Oh, we stood at the altar
The gypsy swore our future was bright
But come the wee wee hours
Well maybe, baby, the gypsy lied

So when you look at me
You better look hard and look twice
Is that me, baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

Tonight our bed is cold
I'm lost in the darkness of our love
God have mercy on the man
Who doubts what he's sure of"

1599,1600,When You Say Nothing At All,Ronan Keating,1999,"It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word, you can light up the dark
Try as I may, I can never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
You say it best (say it best)
When you say nothing at all

All day long, I can hear people talking out loud
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd 
Try as they may, they could never define
What's been said between your heart and mine

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
You say it best (say it best)

Your folks might understand you by and by
So in the mean time, move on up towards your destination
Though you may find from time to time complications

Bite your lip and take a trip
Though there may be wet road ahead
And you cannot slip so what you wanna do
Just move on up for peace you will find
Into the steeple of beautiful people where there's only one kind

So hush now child and don't you cry
Your folks might understand you by and by
So what are we wanna do is move on up for a greater day
But just you gonna make it, you put your mind to it, you can surely do it

Take nothing less than the supreme best
Do not obey for most people say 'cause you can past the test
So what we have to do is move on up and keep on wishing
Remember your dream is your only scheme so keep on pushing

So hush now child and don't you cry

Move on up for a greater day but just you gonna make it

1604,1605,Forever Autumn,Jeff Wayne & Justin Hayward,1978,"Journalist: For three days I fought my way along roads packed with refugees, the homeless, burdened with boxes and bundles containing their valuables. All that was of value to me was in London. By the time I reached their little red brick house, Carrie and her father were gone.

The summer sun is fading as the year grows old,
And darker days are drawing near,
The winter winds will be much colder,
Now you're not here

I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky,
And one by one they disappear,
I wish that I was flying with them,
Now you're not here

Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way,
You always loved this time of year,
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now,
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here

Journalist: Fire suddenly leapt from house to house, the population panicked and ran and I was swept along with them, aimless and lost without Carrie. Finally I headed eastward for the ocean, and my only hope of survival: A boat out of England.

Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes,
As if to hide a lonely tear,
My life will be forever autumn,

'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here

Journalist: As I hastened through Covent Garden, Blackfriars and Billingsgate, more and more people joined the painful exodus. Sad, weary women, their children stumbling and streaked with tears, their men bitter and angry, the rich rubbing shoulder with beggars and outcasts. Dogs snarled and whined, the horses' bits were covered with foam ... and here and there were wounded soldiers, as helpless as the rest. We saw tripods wading up the Thames, cutting through bridges as though they were paper - Waterloo Bridge, Westminster Bridge ... One appeared above Big Ben.

Martians: Ulla!

Journalist: Never before in the history of the world had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered together. This was no disciplined march, it was a stampede, without order and without a goal, six million people, unarmed and unprovisioned, driving headlong. It was the beginning of the rout of civilization, of the massacre of mankind.

A vast crowd buffeted me toward the already packed steamer. I looked up enviously at those safely on board - straight into the eyes of my beloved Carrie! At sight of me she began to fight her way along the packed deck to the gangplank. At that very moment it was raised, and I caught a last glimpse of her despairing face as the crowd swept me away from her.

Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way,
You always loved this time of year,
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now,
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here

Martians: Ulla!

Journalist: The steamer began to move slowly away but on the landward horizon appeared the silhouette of a fighting machine. Another came, and another, striding over hills and plunging far out to sea and blocking the exit of the steamer. Between them lay the silent, grey Ironclad ""Thunder Child"". Slowly it moved towards shore; then, with a deafening roar and whoosh of spray, it swung about and drove at full speed towards the waiting Martians."

1606,1607,Give Up Your Guns,Buoys,1972,"When I woke up this morning
I found myself alone
I turned to touch her hair
But she was gone, she was gone

And there beside my pillow
Were her tears from the night before
She said: ""Give up your guns and face the law""

I robbed a bank in Tampa
And I thought I had it made
But the hounds picked up my trail within the glades
So I ran

And I stumbled on this cabin
And she came to me once more
She said: ""Give up your guns and face the law""

I don't wanna leave her
I don't wanna die
Deep within a cold, cold grave
With no-one 'round to cry

But I've got my pistol
Now it's time to choose
Shooting here or hanging there
And either way I lose

And now I'm in this cabin
Where my own true love should be
Instead there lies a note she wrote to me
And it says:

""No, you can't live by the bullet
But you sure as death can die
My love, give up your guns or say goodbye, goodbye""

And the sheriff now is calling
With his shotgun at my door:
""Son, give up your guns and face the law"""

en volgt het dievenspoor
met schooiers en soldaten,
hun petten op één oor
Je tilt je rokken op
en lacht naar iedere man
die in het donker wel durft
wat overdag niet kan

En bij nacht
in de kroegen hier,
gaat je naam in het rond
bij het blond schuimend bier

Ik ken ze één voor één,
de heren van fatsoen,
ik zal ze nooit vergeten
zoals ze jou wel doen
Hoe vaak heb jij zo'n kop,
bezopen, stom en geil,
niet aan je borst gedrukt,
je lijf nat van zijn kwijl

En bij nacht
in de kroegen hier,
gaat je naam in het rond
bij het blond schuimend bier

Malle Babbe kom,
Malle Babbe kom hier,
lekker stuk, malle meid,
lekker dier van plezier
Malle Babbe is rond,
Malle Babbe is blond,
een zoen op je mond,
Malle Babbe, je lekkere kont

En 's zondags in de kerk
dan zit daar zo'n meneer,
stijf als een houten plank
met spijkers in zijn kop
te kijken in zijn bank
Een zwart lakens pak
om zijn zondige lijf,
bang voor de duivel
en bang voor zijn wijf
En zuinig een cent
in het zakje doen
Zo koopt hij zijn ziel weer terug
en zijn fatsoen

En jij moet achteraan
in het donker ergens staan
zoals het hoort

Maar eens dan komt de dag,
dan luiden ze de klok,
dan draag jij witte bloemen
en linten aan je rok
Wanneer we met elkaar
gearmd de kerk uitgaan,
wat zullen ze dan kijken,
daar denk ik altijd aan

Als bij nacht
in de kroegen hier,
ik je naam weer hoor

1609,1610,Een Meisje Van 16,Boudewijn De Groot,1965,"Ze woonde in een villawijk
Haar ouders waren stinkend rijk
Toch was daar niets meer dat haar bond
Ze gaf zich aan een vagebond
Die sprak van liefde, 't oud verhaal
En zij geloofde 't allemaal

Zo ging ze weg, ze nam niets mee
Alleen haar jeugd en het idee
Dat hij haar man was, zij zijn vrouw
En het altijd zo blijven zou

Arm kind, zestien lentes zo pril
Ach, wat lig je hier stil
Langs de kant van de weg

Ze trokken voort van stad tot stad
Omdat hij ruimte nodig had
Het zwerversleven was te zwaar
Niets voor een kind van zestien jaar
Haar liefde was haar levenslot
Ze ging er langzaam aan kapot

Ze kon de hartstocht niet weerstaan
Moest tot 't einde verder gaan
Ze was geen kind maar ook geen vrouw
En wist niet wat er komen zou

Arm kind, zestien lentes zo pril
Ach, wat lig je hier stil
Langs de kant van de weg

Ze werd vermoeid, zag bleek en vaal
Verloor haar jeugd, haar ideaal
Alleen haar liefde bleef bestaan
Toen ging hij weg bij haar vandaan
Toch had ze kunnen weten dat
Hij niet genoeg aan liefde had

Dat op een dag hij weg zou zijn
En zij alleen met spijt en pijn
Dat hij zolang een meisje had
Als stormwind speelt met een enkel blad

Arm kind, zestien lentes zo pril
Ach, wat lig je hier stil
Langs de kant van de weg"
1610,1611,Toveren,Herman Van Veen,1987,"Als hij kon toveren,
kwam alles voor elkaar.
Als hij kon toveren,
dan werd geen mens te zwaar
en iederen die zong er.
Als hij kon toveren, kon toveren, kon toveren, kon toveren
dan hielden alle mensen van elkaar.

Ieder huis had 100 kamers,
in elke kamer stond tv
en z'n ouders bleven eeuwig leven
en hij leefde met ze mee.
De rivier was niet van water,
maar van sinaasappelsap
en hij zou niet hoeven leren
wat hij eigenlijk niet snapt.

Z'n vriendje zou ineens begrijpen
waaro ie ruzie met 'm kreeg
en iedereen zou voor hem buigen
als hij de troon besteeg
en 's winters lag er altijd sneeuw
en was het lekker warm
en niemand werd er rijk geboren
en niemand werd er arm.

Maar voor een toverspreuk van kwaliteit
ben je zomaar 1000 gulden kwijt
en naar een beetje toverboek
ben je toch wel 50 jaar op zoek
en de hele cursus tovenaar
duurt 125 jaar.
Dat brengt ie allemaal niet op.
Ik denk dat hij voor 't begin al stopt,
want zelfs de oma van z'n oma
had nooit een tovenaarsdiploma."

Each time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race

That's life (that's life), I tell you I can't deny it
I thought of quitting, baby, but my heart just ain't gonna buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king

1613,1614,Midnight Rambler,Rolling Stones,1969,"Did you hear about the midnight rambler
Everybody got to go?
Did you hear about the midnight rambler
The one that shut the kitchen door?

He don't give a hoot of no warning
Wrapped up in a black cat cloak
He don't go in the light of the morning
He split the time the cock'rel crows

Talkin' about the midnight gambler
The one you never seen before, yeah
I'm talkin' about the midnight gambler
Did you see him jump the garden wall?

Sighin' down the wind so sadly
Listen and you'll hear him moan
Yeah, well, talkin' about the midnight gambler
Everybody got to go

Yeah

Did you hear about the midnight rambler?
Well, honey, it's no rock 'n' roll show
Well, I'm talkin' about the midnight gambler
Yeah, the one you never seen before

Well, you heard about the Boston
It's not one of those
Well, talkin' 'bout the midnight, sh
The one that closed the bedroom door

I'm called the hit-and-run raper in anger
The knife-sharpened tippie-toe
Or just the shoot 'em dead, brainbell jangler
You know, the one you never seen before

So if you ever meet the midnight rambler
Coming down your marble hall
Well, he's pouncing like a proud, black panther
Well, you can say I, I told you so

Well, don't you listen for the midnight rambler, yeah
You know, play it easy as you go
I'm gonna smash down all your plate glass windows
Put a fist, put a fist through your steel-plated door

Did you hear about the midnight rambler?
He'll leave his footprints up and down your hall
And did you hear about the midnight gambler
And did you see me make my midnight call?

And if you ever catch the midnight rambler
I'll steal your mistress from under your nose
I'll go easy with your cold fanged anger
I'll stick my knife right down your throat, baby, and it hurts"
1614,1615,Don't You Want Me,Human League,1982,"You were working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
When I met you
I picked you out, I shook you up and turned you around
Turned you into someone new

Now, five years later on, you've got the world at your feet
Success has been so easy for you
But don't forget, it's me who put you where you are now
And I can put you back down too

Don't, don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me

You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry

Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me? Oh!
Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me? Oh!

I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
That much is true
But even then I knew I'd find a much better place
Either with or without you

The five years we have had have been such good times
I still love you
But now I think it's time I lived my life on my own
I guess it's just what I must do

Don't, don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me
Don't, don't you want me?

1615,1616,Goodbye My Lover,James Blunt,2005,"Did I disappoint you or let you down?
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
'Cause I saw the end, before we'd begun
Yes, I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won

So I took what's mine by eternal right
Took your soul out into the night
It may be over but it won't stop there
I am here for you, if you'd only care

You touched my heart, you touched my soul
You changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind, but that I knew when
My heart was blinded by you

I've kissed your lips and held your head
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
I know you well, I know your smell
I've been addicted to you

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

I am a dreamer and when I wake
You can't break my spirit, it's my dreams you take
And as you move on, remember me
Remember us and all we used to be

I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile
I've watched you sleeping for a while
I'd be the father of your child
I'd spend a lifetime with you

I know your fears and you know mine
We've had our doubts but now we're fine
And I love you, I swear that's true
I cannot live without you

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

And I still hold your hand in mine
In mine when I'm asleep
And I will bear my soul in time
When I'm kneeling at your feet

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

I don't know what to do; passing the days without you
Friday night when I see you again
You'll make a fool out of me
I don't wanna be your lover for the weekend

There's something in your eyes that makes me realize
We've got no chance if we're going on this way
You mean such a lot to me
I don't wanna be your lover for the weekend

Love in a woman's heart
I wanna have the whole and not a part
It's strange that this feeling grows more and more
'Cause I've never loved someone like you before

Where everybody goes to be alone
Where you won't see any rising sun
Down to the river we will run

When by the water we drink to the dregs
Look at the stones on the river bed
I can tell from your eyes
You've never been by the riverside

Down by the water the riverbed
Somebody calls you somebody says
Swim with the current and float away
Down by the river everyday

Oh my God I see how everything is torn in the river deep
And I don't know why I go the way
Down by the riverside

When that old river runs pass your eyes
To wash off the dirt on the riverside
Go to the water so very near
The river will be your eyes and ears

I walk to the borders on my own
To fall in the water just like a stone
Chilled to the marrow in them bones
Why do I go here all alone

I ain't coming 'round searching for a crutch
I just want someone to talk to

Ain't no mercy on the streets of this town
Ain't no bread from heavenly skies
Ain't nobody drawing wine from this blood
It's just you and me tonight

Tell me, in a world without pity
Do you think what I'm askin's too much?
I just want something to hold on to
And a little of that human touch
Just a little of that human touch

Oh, girl, that feeling of safety you prize
Well, it comes with a hard, hard price
You can't shut off the risk and the pain
Without losing the love that remains
We're all riders on this train

So you've been broken and you've been hurt
Show me somebody who ain't
Yeah I know, I ain't nobody's bargain
But hell, a little touch up and a little paint

You might need something to hold on to
When all the answers, they don't amount to much
Somebody that you could just to talk to
And a little of that human touch

Baby, in a world without pity
Do you think what I'm askin's too much?
I just want to feel you in my arms
And share a little of that human touch
Share a little of that human touch

Feel a little of that human touch and you
Feel a little of that human touch
Share a little of that human touch I want
Feel a little of that human touch

Happyest thing in the whole wide world
And she was pretty
Ooh yes, she was

And the nI left the place to become a man
And I never thought I'd see her again
And I even failed remembering her name

But the other night at the Studio '54
She came suddenly walking through the front door
And she settled down in my mind again

I can live for another thousand years
When I see the eyes of Jenny
Feels like I'm sailing to another place, another time
There ain't no more worries,
No more fears when I see the eyes of Jenny
It's like they take me to where
She knows I'll find a little piece of mind

She told me she's almost twenty-five
Been through some struggle and some strive
And she is pretty
Ooh, like she was

It's not the color, not the size
Guess it's the promise in those eyes
That makes her pretty
Ooh, like she was

And then I left the place and became a man
I don't know if I'll ever see her again
But I'll always be remembering her name

'Cause the other night at the Studio '54
She came suddenly walking through the front door
And she settled down in my mind again

I can live for another thousand years
When I see the eyes of Jenny
Feels like I'm sailing to another place, another time

And went swimming for hours
And nobody
Nobody's looking
I came to a hotel
With double rooms and showers
And nobody
Nobody's knocking

The phone rings on a nightstand
Somebody whispers 'hello'

Somebody whispers 'hello'

Stealing through the dark of night
Climbing through a window, stepping to the floor
Checking to the left and the right
Picking up the pieces, putting them away
Something doesn't feel quite right

Help me someone, let me out of here
Then out of the dark was suddenly heard
""Welcome to the Home by the Sea""

Coming out the woodwork, through the open door
Pushing from above and below
Shadows with no substance, in the shape of men
Round and down and sideways they go
Adrift without direction, eyes that hold despair
Then as one they sigh and they moan

Help us someone, let us out of here
Living here so long undisturbed
Dreaming of the time we were free
So many years ago
Before the time when we first heard
""Welcome to the Home by the Sea""

Sit down... Sit down
As we relive our lives in what we tell you

Images of sorrow, pictures of delight
Things that go to make up a life
Endless days of summer, longer nights of gloom
Waiting for the morning light
Scenes of unimportance, photos in a frame
Things that go to make up a life

Help us someone, let us out of here
Living here so long undisturbed
Dreaming of the time we were free
So many years ago
Before the time when we first heard
""Welcome to the Home by the Sea""

Sit down... Sit down
As we relive our lives in what we tell you
Let us relive our lives in what we tell you

Sit down... Sit down
Cause you won't get away
No with us you will stay
For the rest of your days. So sit down
As we relive our lives in what we tell you
Let us relive our lives in what we tell you"

1637,1638,Foolish Games,Jewel,1997,"You took your coat off and stood in the rain
You were always crazy like that
And I watched from my window
Always felt I was outside, looking in on you

You were always the mysterious one with dark eyes and careless hair
You were fashionably sensitive but too cool to care
You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather

Well, in case you failed to notice
In case you failed to see
This is my heart, bleeding before you
This is me down on my knees

These foolish games are tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

You were always brilliant in the morning
Smoking your cigarettes, and talking over coffee
You philosophies on art, Baroque moved you, you loved Mozart 
And you'd speak of your loved ones as I clumsily strummed my guitar

Teach me of honest things, things that were daring 
Things that were clean, things that knew what an honest dollar did mean
I hid my soiled hands behind my back
Somewhere along the line, I must've gone off track with you

Excuse me, think I've mistaken you for somebody else
Somebody who gave a damn, somebody more like myself
And these foolish games are tearing me, you're tearing me
You're tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

You took your coat off, stood in the rain
You're always crazy like that"

Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong

You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say good night and stay together

Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

The happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never-ending
Oh, wouldn't it be nice

Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true
Baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
We could be married (We could be married)
And then we'd be happy (And then we'd be happy)
Oh, wouldn't it be nice

You know, it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But let's talk about it
Wouldn't it be nice

Good night, baby
Sleep tight, baby
Good night, baby
Sleep tight, baby"

Quand il me prend dans ses bras
Il me parle tout bas
Je vois la vie en rose

Il me dit des mots d'amour
Des mots de tous le jours
Et ça me fait quelque chose

Il est entré dans mon coeur
Une part de bonheur
Dont je connais la cause

C'est lui pour moi
Moi pour lui
Dans la vie
Il me l'a dit, l'a juré pour la vie

Et dès que je l'aperçois
Alors je sens en moi, mon coeur qui bat

And whispers love to me
Everything's lovely
It's him for me and me for him
All our lives
And it's so real what I feel
This is why

You're simply not in the pink my dear
To be honest you haven't got a clue

I'm one card short of a full deck
I'm not quite the shilling
One wave short of a shipwreck
I'm not my usual top billing
I'm coming down with a fever
I'm really out to sea
This kettle is boiling over
I think I'm a banana tree

1642,1643,Late In The Evening,Paul Simon,1980,"First thing I remember, I was lying in my bed
Couldn't have been no more than one or two
And I remember there was a radio 
Coming from the room next door
And my mother laughed the way some ladies do
Well it's late in the evening 
And the music's seeping through

The next thing I remember, I am walking down the street 
I'm feeling all right, I'm with my boys, I'm with my troops, yeah
And down along the avenue some guys are shootin' pool
And I heard the sound of acapella grooves, yeah
Singin' late in the evening
And all the girls out on the stoops, yeah

Then I learned to play some lead guitar
I was underage in this funky bar 
And I stepped outside and smoked myself a J
And when I come back to the room everybody just seemed to move
And I turned my amp up loud and I began to play
And it was late in the evening
And I blew that room away

The first thing I remember when you came into my life
I said, ""I'm gonna get that girl no matter what I do""
Well I guess I've been in love before
Once or twice I've been on the floor
But I never loved no one the way that I love you
And it was late in the evening 
And all the music seeping through."

Dat ik de zoen die jij me toeblies
Niet meer meekreeg toen ik wegreed?
Je keek me na, ik deed mijn ogen dicht
Ik zag nog je gezicht maar was alleen
Alleen met mijn vrienden en ik wist dat het al laat was
En dat jij steeds sneller uit het zicht verdween
Ik kan alleen maar spelen, mijn noten en mijn rol
Dat is niets om te delen, en het maakt mijn leegte vol
Hier ben ik veilig, hier ben ik sterk
Hier ben ik heilig, dit is mijn kerk
Dit is mijn haven, hier leg ik aan
Hier kan ik slapen, hier moet ik staan
Hier ligt mijn hart voor jou
Ik kijk je aan, je doet je ogen dicht
Je weet waarom ik hier sta en je lacht

Casser la voix, Casser la voix.

J'peux plus croire tout c'qui est marqué sur les murs.
J'peux plus voir la vie des autres même en peinture.
J'suis pas là pour les sourires d'après minuit.
M'en veux pas, si ce soir j'ai envie

D'me casser la voix, Casser la voix,
Casser la voix, Casser la voix.

Les amis qui s'en vont
Et les autres qui restent.
Se faire prendre pour un con
Par des gens qu'on déteste,

Les rendez-vous manqués
Et le temps qui se perd
Entre des jeunes usés
Et des vieux qui espèrent

Et ces flashes qui aveuglent,
A la télé chaque jour,
Et les salauds qui beuglent
La couleur de l'amour

Et les journaux qui traînent,
Comme je traîne mon ennui,
La peur qui est la mienne,
Quand je m'réveille la nuit,

Casser la voix, Casser la voix,
Casser la voix, Casser la voix.

Et les filles de la nuit
Qu'on voit jamais le jour
Et qu'on couche dans son lit
En appelant ça d'l'amour

Et les souvenirs honteux
Qu'on oublie d'vant sa glace
En s'disant ""J'suis dégueu
Mais j'suis pas dégueulasse !""

Doucement les rêves qui coulent
Sous l'regard des parents
Et les larmes qui roulent
Sur les joues des enfants

Et les chansons qui viennent
Comme des cris dans la gorge,
Envie d' crier sa haine
Comme un chat qu'on égorge,

Casser la voix, Casser la voix,
Casser la voix, Casser la voix.

I get so lost sometimes
Days pass
And this emptiness fills my heart

I drive off in my car

I come back to the place you are

All my instincts
They return
The grand façade
So soon will burn

Without a noise
Without my pride
I reach out from the inside

In your eyes
The light, the heat
(In your eyes) I am complete
(In your eyes) I see the doorway
To a thousand churches
(In your eyes) The resolution
(In your eyes) Of all the fruitless searches

Oh, I see the light and the heat
(In your eyes) Oh, I want to be that complete
(In your eyes)
I want to touch the light, the heat I see in your eyes

Love
I don't like to see so much pain
So much wasted
And this moment keeps slipping away

I get so tired
Working so hard for our survival
I look to the time with you
To keep me awake and alive

And all my instincts
They return
And the grand façade
So soon will burn

Without a noise
Without my pride
I reach out from the inside

In your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)
In your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)

In your eyes
The light, the heat
(In your eyes) I am complete
(In your eyes) I see the doorway
To a thousand churches
(In your eyes) The resolution
(In your eyes) Of all the fruitless searches

Oh, I see the light and the heat
(In your eyes) Oh, I want to be that complete
(In your eyes)
I want to touch the light, the heat I see in your eyes

In your eyes, in your eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes

Accepting all I've done and said
I want to stand and stare again
Till there's nothing left out
Oh, it remains there in your eyes
Whatever comes and goes
Oh, it's in your eyes"

It's a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doing for us
And I'm giving all my love to this world
Only to be told
I can't see
I can't breathe
No more will we be
And nothing's going to change the way we live
'Cause we can always take but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse,
See, it's a crazy world we're living in
And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
Is all we have to give these -

Futures made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to, be govern'd by this love we have
For useless, twisting, our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound - for we all live underground

And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made
And now every mother, can choose the colour
Of her child
That's not nature's way
Well that's what they said yesterday
There's nothing left to do but pray
I think it's time I found a new religion
Waoh - it's so insane
To synthesize another strain
There's something in these
Futures that we have to be told.

Futures made of virtual insanity - now
Always seem to, be govern'd by this love we have
For useless, twisting, our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound - for we all live underground

Now there is no sound
If we all live underground
And now it's virtual insanity
Forget your virtual reality
Oh, there's nothing so bad.
I know yeah

Of this virtual insanity, we're livin' in.
Has got to change, yeah
Things, will never be the same.
And I can't go on
While we're livin' in oh, oh virtual insanity
Oh, this world, has got to change
'Cause I just, I just can't keep going on, it was virtual.
Virtual insanity that we're livin' in, that we're livin' in
That virtual insanity is what it is

Futures made of virtual insanity - now
Always seem to, be govern'd by this love we have
For useless, twisting, our new technology

Wipe the miles away

I'll never hear you

Look your love has drawn red from my hands
From my hands you know you'll never be

We've just poked a little empty pie
For the fun that people had at night
Late at night don't need hostility
The timid smile and pause to free

I don't care about their different thoughts
Different thoughts are good for me
Up in arms and chaste and whole
All God's children took their toll

Look my eyes are just holograms
Look your love has drawn red from my hands
From my hands you know you'll never be
More than twist in my sobriety
More than twist in my sobriety

Time to risk a life, a life, a life
Sweet and handsome
Soft and porky
You pig out 'til you've seen the light
Pig out 'til you've seen the light

Half the people read the papers
Read them good and well
Pretty people, nervous people
People have got to sell
News you have to sell

The people are thirsty
'Cause of man's unnatural hand
Watch what happens when the people catch wind
When the water hits the banks of that hard dry land
Clap your hands now
Go 'head and clap your hands now
Clap your hands now
Go 'head and clap your hands now

Get ready for the wave
It might strike like the final flood
The people haven't drank is so long
The water won't even make mud

After it comes, it might come with a steady flow
Grab the roots of the tree down by the river
Fill your cup when your spirit's low

Clap your hands now
Go 'head and clap your hands now
Clap your hands now
Clap your hands now

Dip down and take a drank
And fill your water tank
Dip down and take a drank
And fill your water tank

Let the liquid spirits free

Because of man's unnatural hand
Watch what happens when the people catch wind
Of the water hitting banks of hard dry land

Like a heavy weight
When you feel this crazy society
Adding to the strain
Take a stroll to the nearest waters

Open up your eyes

Give me one cause one is best
In confusion confidence
Give me peace of mind and trust
Don't forget the rest of us
Give me strength, reserve control
Give me heart and give me soul
Wounds that heal and cracks that fix
Tell me your own politik

And open up your eyes 
Open up your eyes 
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Just open up your eyes

But give me love over, love over, love over this
And give me love over, love over, love over this"
1670,1671,7 Years,Lukas Graham,2015,"Once I was seven years old my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about the glory, just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing about everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old

Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still rolling
Soon we'll be 30 years old

I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old

Once I was seven years old, my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

Once I was seven years old"
1671,1672,Fire And Rain,James Taylor,1970,"Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Won't you look down upon me Jesus
You gotta help me make a stand
You just got to see me through another day
My body's achin' and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought they would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Been walkin' my mind to an easy time
My back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

Whoa, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again, now
Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things comin' my way this time around, now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you
Fire and rain, now"

All around my head and in the wind
I had no illusions that I'd ever find
A glimpse of summer's heatwaves in your eyes
You did what you did to me
Now it's history I see
Here's my comeback on the road again
Things will happen while they can
I will wait here for my man tonight
It's easy when you're big in Japan

When you're big in Japan, tonight
Big in Japan, be tight
Big in Japan, where the Eastern sea's so blue
Big in Japan, all right
Pay, then I'll sleep by your side
Things are easy when you're big in Japan
When you're big in Japan...

Neon on my naked skin
Passing silhouettes
Of strange illuminated mannequins
Shall I stay here at the zoo
Or shall I go and change my point of view
For other ugly scenes
You did what you did to me
Now it's history I see
Things will happen while they can
I will wait here for my man tonight

1674,1675,This Is My Life,Shirley Bassey,1979,"Funny how a lonely day, can make a person say: 
What good is my life
Funny how a breaking heart, can make me start to say: 
What good is my life
Funny how I often seem, to think I'll never find a dream 
In my life
Till I look around and see, this great big world is part of me 
And my life
This is my life 
Today, tomorrow, love will come and find me 
But that's the way that I was born to be 
This is me 
This is me 

This is my life 
And I don't give a damn for lost emotions 
I've such a lot of love I've got to give 
Let me live 
Let me live 

Sometime when I feel afraid, I think of what a mess I've made 
Of my life
Crying over my mistakes, forgetting all the breaks I've had 
In my life
I was put on earth to be, a part of this great world is me 
And my life
Guess I'll just add up the score, and count the things I'm grateful for 
In my life
This Is my life 
Today, tomorrow, love will come and find me 
But that's the way that I was born to be 
This is me

1682,1683,Same Love,Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,2013,"Macklemore:
When I was in the third grade
I thought that I was gay
'Cause I could draw, my uncle was
And I kept my room straight

I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before pre-K""
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?

A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like
""Yeah, I'm good at little league""

A preconceived idea of what it all meant
For those who liked the same sex, had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision

And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a predisposition
Playing God

Ah nah, here we go
""America the brave"" still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all His children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know

Mary Lambert:
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

Macklemore:
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're saying
Our culture founded from oppression
Yeah, we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
""Gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself

When I was in church, they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
And that holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen

I might not be the same
But that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal
Damn right I support it
I don't know

Mary Lambert:
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

Macklemore:
We press play
Don't press pause
Progress, march on
With a veil over our eyes
We turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can united by law
Kids are walkin' around the hallway
Plagued by pain in their heart
A world so hateful
Someone would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us
We have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up

Mary Lambert:
And I can't change

To the hip hip hop-a you don't stop the rock
It to the bang-bang boogie, say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

Now what you hear is not a test, I'm rappin' to the beat
And me, the groove and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
See I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say hello
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow

But first I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the riddle that will make your body rock

Well, so far you've heard my voice, but I brought two friends along
And next on the mic is my man Hank: come on, Hank, sing that song

Check it out: I'm the C-a-s-an-the-o-v-a, and the rest is f-l-y
Y'see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix and these reasons, I'll tell ya why:
Y'see I'm six-foot-one and I'm tons of fun, and I dress to a T
Y'see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars that definitely ain't the wack
I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunroof Cadillac

So after school, I take a dip in the pool which is really on the wall
I got a color TV, so I can see the Knicks play basketball
Hear me talkin' 'bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money than a sucker could ever spend
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the rucker, not a dime till I made it again

Y'go hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
Y'say I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spankin', drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
Say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend

Master Gee, am I mellow?
It's on you, so what you gonna do?

Well, it's on n on n on on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said m-a-s, t-e-r, a g with a double e
I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee

Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm goin down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be

Now I'm feelin' the highs and ya feelin' the lows
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
Ya start poppin' ya fingers and stompin' your feet
And movin' your body while you're sittin' in your seat

And then, damn, ya start doin' the Freak
I said damn, right outta your seat
Then ya throw your hands high in the air
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care
With the sure shot MCs for the affair

Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize

Singin' on n n on n on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on n n on n on on n on
Like a hot buttered a pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop, ya don't dare stop
Come alive, y'all, gimme what ya got

I guess by now, you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay I still keep in stride
'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind

The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on n n on n on on n on
Rock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor

I'm gonna freak ya here, I'm gonna feak ya there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put t-t-tickets in your behind

I said 1-2-3-4, come on girls, get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme what ya got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said 1-2-3-4, tell me Wonder Mike, what are you waitin' for?

I said-a hip hop, the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip hop-a you don't stop the rock
It to the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

Skiddlee beebop-a we rock a scoobie doo
And guess what, America, we love you
'Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul
You could rock till you're a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast

Rock it up, baby bubbah
Baby bubbah to the boogie, da bang bang da boogie
To the beat beat, it's so unique
Come on, everybody and dance to the beat

I said-a hip hop, the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop-a you don't stop
Rock it out, baby bubbah, to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie da beat

I said I can't wait till the end of the week
When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind so that you can't speak

And do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called The Freak
And when ya finally do come in to your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak

I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on, Hank, sing that song
To the rhythm of the boogie da bang bang da bong

Well, I'm imp the dimp, the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies

And when you come inside into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MCs try to prove a point
We're treacherous trio, we're the serious joint

A-from sun-to-sun and from day-to-day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic till you can't resist
Everybody, I say, it goes like this:

Well, I was comin' home late one dark afternoon
A reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables

This young reporter, I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said, ""Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you
The Cassanova legend must have been true!""
I said, ""By the way, baby, what's your name?""
Said, ""I go by the name of Lois Lane

And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman""
I said, ""He's a fairy, I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose

He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit""
I said, ""You need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest

He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party till the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm!""

I gon' do it, I gon' do it
I gon' do it, do it, do it
And I'm here, and I'm there
I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere

Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, don't stop y'all
A-tick a-tock, y'all, you don't stop

Go hotel, motel, what you gonna do today? (Say what?)
I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
You say, if your girl starts actin' up then you take her friend

I say skip, dive, what can I say?
I can't fit em all inside my OJ
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house

It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right
Everybody was dancin' on the floor
Doin' all the things they never did before

And then this fly, fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
As she traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white sasoons

She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, ""It's time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece""

And now, people in the house, this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group ya hear is called phase two
And let me tell ya somethin', we're a helluva crew

Once a week we're on the street
Just a-cuttin' the jams and making it free
For you to party, ya got to have the moves
So we'll get right down and give you a groove

For you to dance, you gotta get hype
So we'll get right down and make you rock
Now the system's on and the girls are there
Ya definitely have a rockin affair

But let me tell ya somethin', there's still one fact:
That to have a party, ya got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're makin' it home
And tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn

And while ya sleepin', ya start to dream
And thinkin' how ya danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time

It was phase two, just a-doin' a do
Rockin' ya down 'cause ya know we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
Come alive, girls, get on your feet

To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that it makes ya freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says ya go on
On n on into the break of dawn

Now I got a man comin' on right now
He's guaranteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on, Wonder Mike, do what ya like

Like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet
Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet

Like Dracula without his fangs
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good
Like a tree that's not made out of wood

Like goin' up and not comin' down
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, ya do The Freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat

Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood

So you try to play it off like you think you can
By sayin that you're full
And then your friend says, ""Momma, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh uh, that's bull!""

So your heart starts pumpin', and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says, ""Man, there's plenty of food!""
So you pile some more on your plate

While the stinky foods steamin' your mind starts to dreamin'
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin'
Into something that looks like cheese

Oh so, you say, ""That's it, I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks!""

So you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate

And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says, ""I understand about the food, baby bubbah
But we're still friends""

With a hip hop, the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip-a hop-a you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang bang boogie say up jump the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogie the beat

I say, Hank, can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?
I said, come on make the, make the people move

I go to the halls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well
A big bang, I got clientele

And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice that I ever had
It came from my wise dear old dad

He said, ""Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now, there's a time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die

A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever ya do in your lifetime
Y'never let a MC steal your rhyme!""

So from sixty-six to this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile

I got style, finesse and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look
But there's a thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality

Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite and not a Goddamn word
And I say a little more later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night

A-tick a-tock y'all, a-beat beat y'all
A-let's rock y'all, ya don't stop
Ya go hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
Ya say I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spankin'
Drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends

A-like that y'all, to the beat y'all
Beat beat ya'll, ya don't stop
A-Master Gee, am I mellow?
It's on you, so whatcha gonna do?

Well, like Johnny Carson on The Late Show
A-like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well, like The Bar-Kay's singin' Holy Ghost
The sounds to throw down, they're played the most

It's like my man, Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive, girl, get on your feet

A-like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like The Bar-Kays on the mic
Like gettin' right down for you tonight

Like movin' your body so ya don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like comin' alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously

I said, the age of one, my life begun
At the age of two, I was doin the' do
At the age of three, it was you and me
Rockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee

At the age of four, I was on the floor
Givin' all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five, I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee, it's all the way live

At the age of six, I was a-pickin' up sticks
Rappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed
At the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven
Dontcha know I went off?

I got right on down to the beat, you see
Gettin' right on down, makin' all the girls
Just take of their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak

At the age of eight, I was really great
'Cause every night, you see I had a date
At the age of nine, I was right on time
'Cause every night, I had a party rhyme

Goin' on n n on n on on n on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A-sayin' on n n on n on on n on...
Like a hot buttered de pop de pop de pop
A-saying on n n on n on on n on
I say you don't stop, gimme what ya got
'Cause I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite feast delight
'Cause I'm a helluva man when I'm on the miC
I am the definite feast delight
Come to the Master Gee, you see
The brother who rocks so viciously"

I can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed

Did I build a ship to wreck?

Thousands of red-eyed mice scratching at the door
And don't let the curtain catch you, 'cause you've been here before

And ladies by the score
All dressed in satin
And waiting by the door

Ooh, what a lucky man he was

White lace and feathers
They made up his bed
A gold covered mattress
On which he was led

Ooh, what a lucky man he was
Ooh, what a lucky man he was

He went to fight wars
For his country and his king
Of his honour and his glory
The people would sing

Ooh, what a lucky man he was

'T Is koeler in huis dan aan zee

Je drijft langzaam mee met de stroom

Knikt je zwijgend maar zeer beleefd toe

Want je komt langs de trap naar beneden

Je verduistert de zon met de wind in je rug

How 'bout not equating death with stopping?

1695,1696,Red Mij Niet,Maarten van Roozendaal,2001,"Leg een steen onder je kussen
Brand voor mijn part een kaars
Slacht een lam
Maar red mij niet
Zet een rare muts op
Duw briefjes in een muur
Voorspel de toekomst
Maar red mij niet
Laat je baard staan
Ach man, laat je baard staan
Red mij niet
Trek een jurk aan
Ach man, trek een mooie lange jurk aan
Maar red mij niet
Restaureer je kerk
Stuur je kinderen ten oorlog
Lees handen tot je blind bent
Maar red mij niet
Slik vitamienen tegen kanker
Was je handen in vuur
Versier je voorhoofd met een stip
Maar red mij niet
Jouw hemel 
is voor mij de hel
Een hemel met jou
Is de hel voor mij
Richt je billen naar het westen
Zeg dagenlang hetzelfde woord
Laat je bevrijden door een UFO
Maar red mij niet
Loop met fakkels door de straten
Zeg dat het lukt als je maar wil
Ga op je knieën tot ze blauw zien
Maar red mij niet
Laat mij in mijn zeven sloten
Laat mij de draad volslagen kwijt
Aan gezelligheid ten onder
Richting eindeloze tijd
Uit volle borst op weg naar nergens
Zonder reden zonder doel
Met m'n zeden en m'n zonden
En mijn angstig voorgevoel
Laat mij mijn kont tegen de krib
Laat mij dit goddeloze lied
Hef jij je handen maar ten hemel
Maar red mij niet"
1696,1697,All Summer Long,Kid Rock,2008,"It was 1989
My thoughts were short, my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen
And she was far from in between
It was summertime in northern Michigan

Splashing through the sandbar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

Catching walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock 'n' roll

While we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle

Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Turn it up

Now nothing seems as strange
As when the leaves begin to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I hear that song
And I start to sing along
And think, man, I'd love to see that girl again

And we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

We were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle

Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

Oh God - and my father
Who is also in heaven.
May the light
Of this flickering candle
Illuminate the night the way
Your spirit illuminates my soul.

Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you see me?
Papa, can you find me in the night?

Papa, are you near me?
Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you help me not be
Frightened?

Looking at the skies
I seem to see a million eyes
Which ones are yours?
Where are you now that yesterday
Has waved goodbye
And closed its doors?
The night is so much darker.
The wind is so much colder.

The world I see is so much bigger
Now that I'm alone.

Papa, please forgive me.
Try to understand me.
Papa, don't you know I had no choice?

Can you hear me praying,
Anything I'm saying,
Even though the night is filled
With voices?

I remember ev'rything you taught me
Ev'ry book I've ever read.
Can all the words in all the books
Help me to face what lies ahead?
The trees are so much taller
And I feel so much smaller.
The moon is twice as lonely
And the stars are half as bright.

Papa, how I love you.
Papa, how I need you.
Papa, how I miss you
Kissing me goodnight."

Shackled by your love

With poison on your lips

Should have seen just what was there and not some holy light

Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly
Agreed politely

I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing
So I fell for everything

You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground

You held me down, but I got up
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancin' through the fire
'Cause I am the champion
And you're gonna hear me roar

Louder, louder than the lion
'Cause I am the champion
And you're gonna hear me roar

... oh-oh-oh-ohh
Ohh-oh-oh-oh-ohh
Ohh-oh-oh-oh-ohh
You're gonna hear me roar

Now I'm floatin' like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes
I went from zero
To my own hero

You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground

You held me down, but I got up
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancin' through the fire
'Cause I am the champion

The sunshine fills my hair
And dreams hang in the air
Gulls in the sky and in my blue eyes
You know it feels unfair
There's magic everywhere

Look at me standing
Here on my own again
Up straight in the sunshine

No need to run and hide
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
No need to laugh and cry
It's a wonderful, wonderful life

The sun's in your eyes
The heat is in your hair
They seem to hate you
Because you're there
And I need a friend
Oh, I need a friend
To make me happy
Not stand here on my own

Look at me standing
Here on my own again
Up straight in the sunshine

No need to run and hide
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
No need to laugh and cry
It's a wonderful, wonderful life

I need a friend
Oh, I need a friend
To make me happy
Not so alone

1722,1723,Famous Blue Raincoat,Leonard Cohen,1971,"It's four in the morning, the end of December
I'm writing you now just to see if you're better
New York is cold, but I like where I'm living
There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening

I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert
You're living for nothing now
I hope you're keeping some kind of record

Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night that you planned to go clear
Did you ever go clear?

Ah, the last time we saw you, you looked so much older
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
You'd been to the station to meet every train
And you came home without Lili Marlene

And you treated my woman
To a flake of your life
And when she came back
She was nobody's wife

Well, I see you there with the rose in your teeth
One more thin gypsy thief
Well, I see Jane's awake
She sends her regards

And what can I tell you, my brother, my killer
What can I possibly say?
I guess that I miss you
I guess I forgive you
I'm glad you stood in my way

If you ever come by here
For Jane or for me
Your enemy is sleeping
And his woman is free

Yes, and thanks
For the trouble you took from her eyes
I thought it was there for good so I never tried

And Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night that you planned to go clear

Sincerely, L. Cohen"

No, I can't get it out of my head

'Cause I can't get it out of my head

Can't move, it's an ebb tide
Morning don't get here till night
Searching for her silver light

So full of the superficial

I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo
In so much space

And when you're out there, without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much, mmm

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice
That's my only advice, mmm

Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha ha ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?

Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember
Is thinking, I want to be like them

Mmm, ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably"
1731,1732,Violet Hill,Coldplay,2008,"Was a long and dark December; from the rooftops I remember
There was snow; white snow
Clearly I remember, from the windows they were watching
While we froze, down below
When the future's architectured by a carnival of idiots
On show, you'd better lie low
If you love me, won't you let me know?

Was a long and dark December, when the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God
Priests clutched onto Bibles, hollowed out to fit their rifles
And the cross was held aloft
Bury me in armour; when I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze
And if you love me, won't you let me know?

I don't want to be a soldier, who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow, far below
So if you love me, why'd you let me go?

I took my love down to Violet Hill; there we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still
So if you love me, won't you let me know?
If you love me, won't you let me know?"
1732,1733,Green Green Grass Of Home,Tom Jones,1966,"The old home town looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and papa
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Yes, they've all come to meet me
Arms reachin' smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Then I awake and look around me
At four gray walls that surround me
And I realize yes, I was only dreamin'
There's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak
Again I'll touch the green, green grass of home

Yes, they'll all come to see me
In the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home"
1733,1734,Need You Now,Lady Antebellum,2010,"Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor
Reachin' for the phone, 'cause I can't fight it any more
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now

Another shot o' whiskey, can't stop lookin' at the door
Wishing you'd come sweepin' in the way you did before
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now 
And I don't know how I can do without; I just need you now

Whoa-oh-whoa
Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now

You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright

We can work it out and get it straight or say good night

We can work it out

For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime

1736,1737,Kalverliefde,Robert Long,1974,"Ja kalverliefde was het wel
misschien zelfs min of meer een spel
dat werd gespeeld,
en met je hobby's werd gedeeld

soms zat je samen in een klas
of liep je door het hoge gras
buiten de stad
onhandig mompelde je wat
onhandig fluisterde je: schat!

ook ging je met haar mee naar huis
en deed je huiswerk bij haar thuis
dan zei ze: mam?! mag hij straks ook een boterham?

ze zeiden dat je met haar ging
want om je pink droeg jij haar ring
met rode steen, die gaf ze eerder aan geen een..
zo'n mooie ring had jij alleen

dan komt de tijd waarop je ziet
met meisjes lopen is toch niet zo als je dacht
wat had je eigenlijk verwacht?

je kleurde diep tot in je nek
als vriendjes riepen: Meiden gek!
omdat je wist, met vissen had men jou gemist
en liever had jij ook gevist

en 's avonds zeg je na een feest
waar je met haar bent heen geweest
hier is je ring..
wat moet ik met dat klere ding?!

en het leek haar 's avonds nog zo echt
en nu opeens heb jij gezegt..
ik wil nie meer..
de eerste keer doet zo iets zeer

dan lig je huilend in je bed
je voelt een redeloos verzet
en ook de pijn
je denkt zo zal het nooit meer zijn
zo zal het zeker nooit meer zijn
je weet zo zal het nooit meer zijn"
1737,1738,The Hardest Part,Coldplay,2006,"And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
Was the hardest part

And the strangest thing
Was waiting for that bell to ring
It was the strangest start

I could feel it go down
Bittersweet, I could taste in my mouth
Silver lining the cloud
Oh, and I
I wish that I could work it out

And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
You really broke my heart, oh

And I tried to sing
But I couldn't think of anything
And that was the hardest part, oh, oh

I could feel it go down
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
You're silver lining the cloud
Oh, and I
Oh, and I
I wonder what it's all about

I wonder what it's all about

Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do, it just comes undone
And everything is torn apart

Oh, and that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part
Yeah, that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part"

Who is the one that always makes you laugh
Who is the reason you were smiling
And dragged you through these times, so rough

I was the one that made you happy
I was the one that eased the pain
But I'm the reason that you're crying now
My own tears scattered by the rain

You can sacrifice me
You can sacrifice me
You can set me free
You can be who you wanna be

Deeper than deep you took me on a trip baby
You shared your wildest dreams and more
You dare me to express my feelings to you
I never felt that need before

But suddenly you needed freedom
You felt the need to break free
You started drowning in your sorrow
You didn't wanna know I had the key

You can sacrifice me
You can sacrifice me
You can set me free
You can be who you wanna be

You can sacrifice me, sacrifice me

1739,1740,Still Believe,Herman Brood & His Wild Romance,1978,"You make me feel
Like I've drawn
A loser's card
But every time you walk out of me
I find myself left
With a broken heart
But it ain't my way to quit mom,
I came to win child
May have run out of luck
But I'm pretty shure
It's gonna come back again
It's gonna come back
Keep on tryin' child - keep on tryin'
Keep on tryin' - keep on tryin'
'Cause I

Still believe that I can win (3 x)
Your love



Found myself in a freight train
Rolling down the track
To the hazy landscape
Goin' to town
I scored myself some hard porno
New Playboy, the new Penthouse
Doin' the hand jive
Just to kill the time
But it ain't my way to quit mom,
I came to win
May have run out of luck
But I'm pretty shure
It's gonna come back again
It's gonna come - it's gonna come back
Keep on tryin' - keep on tryin'
Gonna keep on tryin' - keep on tryin'

Still believe that I can win (4 x)
Your love"
1740,1741,Master Blaster (Jammin'),Stevie Wonder,1980,"Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried

From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

Didn't know you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
See, nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
We'll be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on

They want us to join the fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away

Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the One
Now's the time for celebration
'Cause we've only just begun

Didn't know you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
See, nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn

See, nobody ever told you that you
(We're in the middle of the making)
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
(Of the master blaster, jammin')
I know nobody told you that you
(We're in the middle of the making)
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
(Of the master blaster, jammin')
We're jammin', jammin', jam, jam on

You ask me am I happy
Well, as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
'Cause we've all just made a pact

We've agreed to get together
Joined as children in Jah
When you're moving in the positive
Your destination is the brightest star

You didn't know that you
(We're in the middle of the making)
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
(Of the master blaster, jammin')
Bet you nobody told you that you
(We're in the middle of the making)
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
(Of the master blaster, jammin')

Oh-oh-oh, whoa, you
(We're in the middle of the making)
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
(Of the master blaster, jammin')
Don't you stop the music, oh no
(We're in the middle of the making)
Baby, babe now
(Of the master blaster, jammin')
No-no, no-no-no
(We're in the middle of the making)
No-no-no, don't babe, nobody, don't do it
(Of the master blaster, jammin')
Oh-oh-oh, no, you
(We're in the middle of the making)
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
(Of the master blaster, jammin')

I bet you if someone approached you yesterday
To tell you that you would be jammin'
You would not believe it
Because you never thought that you would be jammin'

Oh-oh-oh, no, no
(We're in the middle of the making)
Jammin' until the break of dawn

Oh, oh
(We're in the middle of the making)

1743,1744,Hart Van Mijn Gevoel,De Kast,1999,"De contouren in het land
Vervagen in de mist
Het schemer wordt verdrongen
De nacht wordt uitgewist
In een doolhof van emoties
Is de tijd voorbijgegaan
Dan loop ik naar de kamer
Waar jouw spullen niet meer staan

Ik pak de eerste krant
Ik blader er doorheen
En als ik koffie wil gaan zetten
Zet ik teveel voor mij alleen
Ik moet wennen aan de leegte
Die jij hier achterliet
Ik had zoveel idealen
Maar zonder jou heb ik ze niet

't Is net of ik mezelf verloren ben
't Is net of ik de diepste dalen ken
In het hart van mijn gevoel
Zal ik je nooit vergeten
In het hart van mijn gevoel mis ik je lach
Had ik kunnen weten
Dat het leven zonder jou me breken zou
Vanaf de eerste dag

M'n werk is blijven liggen
Maar ik voel me uitgeteld
Het lichaam lamgeslagen
Als door de griep geveld
In de alledaagse dingen
Schuilt een groot verdriet
Ik moet opnieuw beginnen
Maar zover ben ik nog niet

t Is net of ik mezelf verloren ben
't Is net of ik de diepste dalen ken
In het hart van mijn gevoel
Zal ik je nooit vergeten
In het hart van mijn gevoel mis ik je lach
Had ik kunnen weten
Dat het leven zonder jou me breken zou
Vanaf de eerste dag
Zou ik m'n wilskracht
Naar de hemel kunnen stijgen
De rotsen laten splijten
Om jou terug te krijgen

In het hart van mijn gevoel
Zal ik je nooit vergeten
In het hart van mijn gevoel mis ik je lach
Had ik kunnen weten
Dat het leven zonder jou me breken zou

This paint-by-numbers life is fucking with my head
Once again

You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

Yes, she caught my eye as I walked on by
She could see from my face that I was fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last till the end

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place

Cuenta una leyenda
Que una hembra gitana
Conjuró a la luna
Hasta el amanecer
Llorando pedía
Al llegar el día
Desposar un calé

""Tendrás a tu hombre piel morena""
Desde el cielo habló la luna llena
""Pero a cambio quiero
El hijo primero
Que le engendres a él""
Que quien a su hijo inmola
Para no estar sola
Poco le iba a querer

¡Luna! Quieres ser madre
Y no encuentras querer
Que te haga mujer
¡Dime! luna de plata
Qué pretendes hacer
Con un niño de piel
Hijo de la Luna

De padre canela nació un niño
Blanco como el lomo de un armiño
Con los ojos grises
En vez de aceituna
Niño albino de luna
""¡Maldita su estampa
¡Este hijo es de un payo
Y yo no me lo callo!""

¡Luna! Quieres ser madre
Y no encuentras querer
Que te haga mujer
¡Dime! luna de plata
Qué pretendes hacer
Con un niño de piel
Hijo de la Luna

Gitano al creerse deshonrado
Se fue a su mujer cuchillo en mano
""¿De quién es el hijo?
¡Me has engañao fijo!""
Y de muerte la hirió
Luego se hizo al monte
Con el niño en brazos
Y allí le abandonó

¡Luna! Quieres ser madre
Y no encuentras querer
Que te haga mujer
¡Dime! luna de plata
Qué pretendes hacer
Con un niño de piel
Hijo de la Luna

Y en las noches que haya luna llena
Será porque el niño esté de buenas
Y si el niño llora
Menguará la luna
Para hacerle una cuna
Y si el niño llora
Menguará la luna
Para hacerle una cuna"

Maar 't dier laat hem altijd mooi fluiten
'T Dier preekt ernstig voor de vissen
Gevallen van een haringkar

Waar komt hij vandaan?

Hij koestert de dagen van rood cellofaan
Van glitter en watten en sterrenpapier

Lantaarnopstekers gaan stil door de nacht
Hij speelt z'n draailier voor hun harige gezicht
Slaap gerust, sluimer zacht
Een paladijn met zijn soldaten blijft even luisteren naar hem

Toch blijft z'n schotel leeg, ze lachen
Alleen een meisje blijft staan praten
Een mager meisje van plezier

Waarom speel jij geen ander lied?
Je ogen en je mond zijn koud

Ik weet geen refrein

Ik draag op m'n borsten een sleutel van goud
'T Licht in m'n oog is een ster die verschiet

Zo kan ik niet zijn

Ze danst in de sneeuw en ze speelt tamboerijn
Terwijl de lapjeskat heel stil de passie preekt
Het geurt naar brood en warme wijn
En in de sneeuwnacht bij de ballen verwachten ze 't nieuwe jaar

De laatste dag komt aangevlogen
De laatste slagen zijn gevallen
'N Vuurpijl spuit de hemel in

En morgen verdwijnen ze over 't land (Morgen verdwijnen ze over 't land)
Het nieuwe jaar is wijd en groen (Een bloemenwei is leeg en groen)
Nooit zien ze hem weer

Wie weet wat de dagen dit jaar zullen doen
Zij speelt met de kat en hij zwaait met zijn hand
Vaarwel en tot ziens (Vaarwel en tot ziens)
Misschien tot ziens (Misschien tot ziens)

And the morals that they worship will be gone
And the men who spurred us on
Sit in judgment of all wrong
They decide and the shotgun sings the song

I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again

The change it had to come
We knew it all along
We were liberated from the fold, that's all
And the world looks just the same
And history ain't changed
'Cause the banners, they all flown in the last war

I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
No, no!

I'll move myself and my family aside
If we happen to be left half alive
I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky
For I know that the hypnotized never lie
Do ya?

Yeah

There's nothing in the street
Looks any different to me
And the slogans are replaced, by the bye
And the parting on the left
Is now parting on the right
And the beards have all grown longer overnight

I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Get up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
Don't get fooled again
No, no

Yeah

Meet the new boss
Same as the old boss"
1757,1758,Take It To The Limit,Eagles,1975,"All alone at the end of the evening
And the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have
Loved me and I never knew
You know I've always been a dreamer
(Spent my life running 'round)
And it's so hard to change
(Can't seem to settle down)
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out
And turning out the same

So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

You can spend all your time making money
You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still be mine?

And when you're looking for your freedom
(Nobody seems to care)
And you can't find the door
(Can't find it anywhere)
When there's nothing to believe in
Still you're coming back, you're running back
You're coming back for more

So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit one more time"

'k Wil terug naar de kust
Heel ongerust zoek ik de weg naar de kust
Bijna niet bewust van de dreiging dat daar m'n jeugd voorbijging

'k Voel me hier niet goed waar ik wonen moet
Tussen al die mensen
Laat me nu maar gaan achter de meeuwen aan
En mijn vage wensen
'k Wil terug naar de kust
Heel ongerust zoek ik de weg naar de kust
Bijna niet bewust van de dreiging dat daar m'n jeugd voorbijging

Oh, hoe kom ik hier vandaan
Was ik maar niet weggegaan

Had ik eerder maar geloofd
Wat die stem toen heeft voorspeld
Dat geluk verdwijnt voor geld
Mist en regen, westenwind
Zeg mij of ik 't ooit weer vind

1759,1760,Reflections,Diana Ross & The Supremes,1967,"Through the mirror of my mind
Time after time
I see reflections of you and me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Oh, I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
'Cause although you're gone
I keep holding on
To the happy times
Oh, when you were mine

As I peer through the window
Of lost time
Looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects the love that used to be

In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust

After all the nights
I sat alone and wept
Just a handful of promises
Are all that's left of loving you

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust"
1760,1761,One Day I'll Fly Away,Randy Crawford,1980,"I make it alone
When love is gone
Still you made your mark
Here in my heart

One day I'll fly away
Leave your love to yesterday
What more can your love do for me
When will love be through with me

I follow the night
Can't stand the light
When will I begin
My life again

One Day I'll fly away
Leave your love to yesterday
What more can your love do for me
When will love be through with me
Why live life from dream to dream
And dread the day that dreaming ends

One day I'll fly away leave your love to yesterday
What more can your love do for me
When will love be through with me
Why live life from dream to dream 
And dread the day that dreaming ends

One day I'll fly away, fly away, fly away"
1761,1762,Heartbreak Hotel,Elvis Presley,1956,"Well, since my baby left me
In the fiery place to dwell
It's down at the end of Lonely Street
At Heartbreak Hotel

I've been so lonely, baby
Well, I'm so lonely
I'll be so lonely I could die

Oh, although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken hearted lovers
To cry away their gloom

They've been so lonely, baby
Well, they're so lonely
Well, they're so lonely they could die

Now, the bellhop's tears keep flowin'
And the desk clerk's dressed in black
Well, they been so long on Lonely Street
They never ever look back

And it's so lonely, baby
Well they're so lonely
Well, they're so lonely they could die

Well, if your baby leaves you
And you got a tale to tell
Just take a walk down Lonely Street
To Heartbreak Hotel

You'll be so lonely, baby
You're gonna be lonely
You'll be so lonely you could die

1762,1763,Don't Stand So Close To Me,Police,1980,"Young teacher, the subject
Of schoolgirl fantasy
She wants him so badly
Knows what she wants to be
Inside him, there's longing
This girl's an open page
Book marking, she's so close now
This girl is half his age

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

Her friends are so jealous
You know how bad girls get
Sometimes it's not so easy
To be the teacher's pet
Temptation, frustration
So bad it makes him cry
Wet bus stop, she's waiting
His car is warm and dry

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

Loose talk in the classroom
To hurt they try and try
Strong words in the staff room
The accusations fly
It's no use, he sees her
He starts to shake and cough
Just like the old man in
That book by Nabokov

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

Don't stand, don't stand so

And you'll be owning all the fines

Do we know how much we've lost
Will the moon be shining as bright as before

The tears well up in my eyes I will always wonder
Why I will never have the life I wanted
Now I'm letting it go

No I don't wanna hurt no more
There's not much more to say

Only pain lovin' me
Things that we won't do for love

Can't stop thinking 'bout it

Just to cure it 'cause I can't ignore it if it's love (love)
Makes me wanna turn around and face me
But I don't know nothing 'bout love, uh

Come on, come on, turn a little faster
Come on, come on, the world will follow after
Come on, come on, because everybody's after love

So I said I'm a snowball running
Running down into the spring that's coming
All this love melting under blue skies
Belting out sunlight, shimmering love

Never ever end-er all this love
Well, I didn't mean to do it
But there's no escaping your love, uh

Indians in the summer
With a teenage diplomat
In the dumps with the mumps
As the adolescent pumps
His way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder

I tripped a merry-go-round
With this very unpleasing
Sneezing and wheezing

Came by in his curly wurly

But mama, that's where the fun is

Some brimstone baritone
Anticyclone rolling stone
Preacher from the east
Says, ""Dethrone the dictaphone
Hit it in its funny bone
That's where they expect it least""

Was standing in the corner
Watching the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone
Was messing with his frozen zone
Reminding him of romance

Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free

I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
I saw the lights go down and standing in front of me

In my scarecrow dreams
When they smashed my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose, come burst in the concrete
Be a cartoon heart

Light a fire, fire the spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart, we'll run wild
We'll be glowing in the dark
We'll be glowing in the dark

All the boys, all the girls, all that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls, all the madness that occurs
All the highs, all the lows as the room is spinning

We love to the sound of our favourite song

To hold your body close
Take another step into the no man's land

But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing ""We Found Love"" in a local rave, no
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name and said ""it's nice to meet ya""
Then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness
I'm in deep if anybody finds out
I'm meant to drive home but I drunk all of it down
Not sober enough we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another now she's kissing my mouth

1777,1778,Story Of My Life,One Direction,2013,"Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open, but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

Written on these walls are the colours that I can't change
Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning, I'll see us in the light upon the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holdin' on so tight
With nothing in between

The story of my life I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

And I've been waiting for this time to come around
But baby, running after you is like chasing the clouds
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time is frozen

The story of my life I give her hope (Give her hope)
I spend her love until she's broke inside (Until she's broke inside)
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life"

It becomes a savage beast
Can't they control it
Why don't they hold it back

You see, my friend and me
Don't have an easy day
And at night we dance, not fight
And we need the energy
If not the sympathy

But I'm brutalized by bass
And terrorized by treble
I'm open to change my mood but
I always get caught in the middle

And I get tired of DJs
Why is it always what he plays
I'm gonna push right through
I'm gonna tell him to
Tell him to
Play us
Play us a slow song
Play us a slow song

It's late, I'm winding down
Am I the only one
To want a strong and silent sound
To pick me up and undress me
Lay me down and caress me

I feel you touch my hand
And whisper in my ear
Ask me how I'm feeling now
And I want to get near you
But I can't even hear you

But this is a fine romance
If we have to be so demanding
We need just one more dance to
Leave here with an understanding

And I get tired of DJs
Why's it always what he plays
I'm gonna push right through
I'm gonna tell him to
Tell him to

But I'm at home and I just don't belong ...

So far away from the garden we love
She is what moves in the soul of a dove
Soon I shall see just how black was my night
When we're alone in her city of light

Rising from the neon gloom
Shining like a crazy moon
Yeah, she turns me on like a fire

You play the role of having sense, I always played the fool
Now something's different, I don't know the reason why
Whenever we separate, I almost want to cry

Oh no, please not that again
Love rears up its ugly head

And when I come home late, you don't complain or call
So as a consequence, I don't go out at all
My friends are frightened, they don't know what's going on
They think you put a spell on me and now my mind is gone

Oh no, please not that again
Love rears up its ugly head
Its ugly head

Love's not so bad they say
But you never know where love is gonna go
Does anybody really know oh?

Check this out

I'm standing at the altar as they play the wedding march
I'm in a black tuxedo with my collar full of starch
She looks as lovely as she's ever gon' get
I wake up from this nightmare in a pool of sweat

Not that again, yeah

I'm not going when

And no matter what you do
When you're lonely, I'll be lonely too
Oh mister Blue,
I'm here to stay with you
And no matter what you do
When you're lonely, I'll be lonely too

A young girl she's shaded, bears the scars that never faded
Of the baby that was born on Christmas day
While the heavens sing their song, a child his life is never long
Cause the food supplies will only last a day

I'm mister Blue,
I'm here to stay with you
And no matter what you do
When you're lonely, I'll be lonely too
Oh mister Blue,
I'm here to stay with you
And no matter what you do
When you're lonely, I'll be lonely too

Patriot emotion is the cause of the commotion
After all there's really no one here to blame
Soldiers taking orders 'cause they must defend the borders
Of our nation and the other side is the same

I'm mister Blue,
I'm here to stay with you
And no matter what you do
When you're lonely, I'll be lonely too
Oh mister Blue,
I'm here to stay with you
And no matter what you do
When you're lonely, I'll be lonely too

I'll come to you at night, when all the world is sleeping tight
And lie beside you till the early morning dew
You can't hear me, you can't see me, you can't feel me when you read
The folded letter she left addressed to you

The stairs creak as you sleep, it's keepin' me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
And some days I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

There's an old voice in my head that's holdin' me back
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young
And full of life and full of love
Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Don't listen to a word I say
The screams all sound the same
Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

You're gone, gone, gone away, I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothin' we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Now, wait, wait, wait for me, please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep

Don't listen to a word I say

And if he happens to be free
I bet he wouldn't fancy me

To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game

And I want to rock your gypsy soul

After all the loves of my life
You'll still be the one

I will take my life into my hands

1797,1798,Into Temptation,Crowded House,1989,"You opened up your door
I couldn't believe my luck
You in your new blue dress
Taking away my breath
The cradle is soft and warm
It couldn't do me no harm
You're showing me how to give

Into temptation
Knowing full well, the Earth will rebel
Into temptation
A muddle of nervous words

Could never amount to betrayal
The sentence is all my own
The price is to watch it fail
As I turn to go
You looked at me for half a second
With an open invitation
For me to go

Into temptation
Knowing full well, the Earth will rebel
Into temptation
Safe in the wide open arms of Hell

We can go sailing in
Climb down, lose yourself when you linger long
Into temptation
Right where you belong
The guilty get no sleep

In the last slow hours of morning
Experience is cheap
I should've listened to the warning
But the cradle is soft and warm

Into temptation
Knowing full well, the Earth will rebel
Into your wide open arms
No way to break this spell
Break this spell
Don't tell"

Should I stay or should I go?

So you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?

You're happy when I'm on my knees
One day is fine and next is black
So if you want me off your back

Well, come on and let me know
Should I stay or should I go?

Should I stay or should I go now?

If I go there will be trouble
And if I stay it will be double

Don't you know which clothes even fit me? (¿Sabes que ropa me quedar?)

Come on and let me know (Pero tienes que decir)
Should I cool it or should I blow? (¿Me debo ir o quedarme?)

1800,1801,Hier Komt De Storm,Frank Boeijen,1988,"Het was windstil
Op een zondag
Dat ik besloot
Later vrij te zijn
Gevangen in eenzaamheid
Je weet wel hoe dat afliep
Na die nacht bleef jij bij mij
Verlangen kan zo sterk zijn

Maar waar is de storm
Waar is de bliksem
Word wakker kijk mij aan
Waar is de storm
Waar is de bliksem
Sta op het is tijd
Om te gaan

Belofte maakt schuld
In jouw ogen 
Scheen een licht 
Bestemd voor mij
Er is niemand
Die daar recht in kijkt
Jij had zo je vrienden
En ik bleef maar staan
Tot jij mij zag
De woorden die jij
Tegen mij zei

Waar is de storm
Waar is de bliksem
Het vuur gloeit onder de vulkaan
Waar blijft de storm
Waar blijft de bliksem
Sta op het is tijd
Om te gaan

Wat laat ik achter
Verbrande schepen
Een stad vol verliezers
En een deel van mijn leven
En een paar vrienden
Met wat vage beloftes
Maar ik neem jou mee
Als jij dat wilt

Heb jij soms dat gevoel ook
Niet thuis te horen
In deze tijd
Maar in een film
Uit de jaren vijftig
James Dean ging vroeg dood
Zijn droom
Kwam snel aan een eind
Maar ik wil
Nog zo lang hier zijn

Want hier komt de storm
Hier komt de bliksem
Splijt de hemel
Breek de maan
Hier komt de storm
Hier komt de bliksem
Sta op het is tijd
Om te gaan

Wat laat ik achter
Een huis vol met leegte
Waar ik nooit thuis kwam
Maar op bezoek bij een vreemde

Ik wil jouw geur in mijn lakens
Ik wil jouw gezicht in mijn spiegel
Ik wil jouw hand op mijn lichaam
Ik wil jouw mond op mijn mond
Ik wil jouw fluister in mijn oren
Ik wil jouw lach in mijn ogen
Ik wil jou kussen in mijn armen
Ik wil jouw hart op mijn tong

Ik wil jouw stem in mijn dromen"
1801,1802,Bullet The Blue Sky,U2,1987,"In the howlin' wind
Comes a stingin' rain
See it drivin' nails
Into the souls on the tree of pain.

From the firefly
A red orange glow
See the face of fear
Runnin' scared in the valley below

Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue

In the locust wind
Comes a rattle and hum
Jacob wrestled the angel
And the angel was overcome

You plant a demon seed
You raise a flower of fire
We see them burnin' crosses
See the flames, higher and higher

Woh, woh, bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue

Suit and tie comes up to me
His face red like a rose on a thorn bush
Like all the colours of a royal flush
And he's peelin' off those dollar bills
(Slappin' 'em down)
One hundred, two hundred.

And I can see those fighter planes
And I can see those fighter planes
Across the tin huts as children sleep
Through the alleys of a quiet city street
Up the staircase to the first floor
We turn the key and slowly unlock the door
As a man breathes into his saxophone
And through the walls you hear the city groan
Outside, is America
Outside, is America
America

See across the field
See the sky ripped open
See the rain comin' through the gapin' wound
Howlin' the women and children
Who run into the arms
Of America."
1802,1803,Honesty,Billy Joel,1978,"If you search for tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love you need to live

But if you look for truthfulness
You might just as well be blind
It always seems to be so hard to give

Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

I can always find someone
To say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve

But I don't want some pretty face
To tell me pretty lies
All I want is someone to believe

Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

I can find a lover, I can find a friend
I can have security until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me with promises again
I know, I know

When I'm deep inside of me
Don't be too concerned
I won't ask for nothin' while I'm gone

But when I want sincerity
Tell me, where else can I turn?
'Cause you're the one that I depend upon

Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you"

1804,1805,No Son Of Mine,Genesis,1991,"Well the key to my survival 
Was never in much doubt
The question was how I could keep sane 
Trying to find the way out
Things were never easy for me
Peace of mind was hard to find
And I needed a place where I could hide
Somewhere I could call mine

I didn't think much about it 
Till it started happening all the time
Soon I was living with the fear every day 
Of what might happen that night
I couldn't stand to hear the crying 
Of my mother, and I remember when 
I swore that, that would be the last they'd see of me
And I never went home again

They say that time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say
Well, he sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straight in the eyes
He said, you're no son, you're no son of mine
You're no son, you're no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
And you're no son, you're no son of mine

Oh, his words how they hurt, I'll never forget it
And as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it 
You're no son, you're no son of mine
But where should I go, and what should I do
You're no son, you're no son of mine
But I came here for help, oh I came here for you

Well the years, they passed so slowly
I thought about him every day
What would I do if we passed on the street?
Would I keep running away?
In and out of hiding places
Soon I'd have to face the facts
We'd have to sit down and talk it over
And that would mean going back

They say that time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same
But I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say
He sat me down to talk to me
And he looked me straight in the eyes
He said, you're no son, you're no son of mine
You're no son, you're no son of mine
When you walked out, you left us behind
And you're no son, you're no son of mine

Oh, his words how they hurt, I'll never forget it
And as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it
You're no son, you're no son of mine
But where should I go, and what should I do
You're no son, you're no son of mine
But I came here for help, oh I was looking for you

Understand the toil of expectations in your mind

Eclipse, you elevate my

Been living like a mole now
Going down, excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly so high
Elevation

A star, lit up like a cigar
Strung out like a guitar
Maybe you could educate my mind
Explain all these controls
I can't sing but I've got soul
The goal is elevation

A mole, digging in a hole
Digging up my soul now
Going down, excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly so high
Elevation

Love, lift me out of these blues
Won't you tell me something true
I believe in you

En een vent zeurt aan je kop
Wat wil die man in hemelsnaam
Hoe kom je hier
Hoe kom je hier vandaan
En als je wegkomt
Waarheen wou je dan wel gaan
Hij praat maar door maar jij dwaalt af
Dus je weet niet wie de wedstrijd wint
Als je luistert naar de wolken
Als je luistert naar de wind
Je agenda en je zonnebril
Wat doen die hier nou
Maar je ligt weer in je eigen bed
In je eigen lot
En opeens staat alles stil

Van al het geld en alle tijd
Op de onverharde wegen
Die je naar hier hebben geleid
De ochtenden zijn wit en koud
En hoe je ook je stuur vasthoudt
De wind komt door je handschoenen heen
Je vingers zijn versteend
Zo is er altijd iets wat je verlamt
En is het niet de wiet
Dan is het wel de drank of zo
Het spookt maar in je hoofd
‘t Was lang geleden een eeuwigheid
Je fietste op de Afsluitdijk
En ik weet niet wat je er nu van vindt

Als je luistert naar de wind

As they drag you by your feet
But the hangman isn't hanging
And they put you on the street

Yeah, you go back, Jack, do it again
Wheel turnin' round and round
You go back, Jack, do it again

When you know she's no high climber
Then you find your only friend
In a room with your two-timer
And you're sure you're near the end
Then you love a little wild one
And she brings you only sorrow
All the time you know she's smiling
You'll be on your knees tomorrow

Yeah, you go back, Jack, do it again
Wheel turnin' round and round
You go back, Jack, do it again

Now you swear and kick and beg us
That you're not a gambling man
Then you find you're back in Vegas
With a handle in your hand
Your black cards can make you money
So you hide them when you're able
In the land of milk and honey
You must put them on the table

Dan iets houden wat je toch niet mist
Liever buiten ook al is het koud
Dan naar binnen als daar niets meer is

Hier is niets om voor te blijven
Hier is alleen nog wat er was
En dat neem ik mee voor altijd
Voor altijd

Wie legt me uit hoe alles werkt
Hoe groot het gat is tussen nu en nooit
En hoe het komt dat ik nu merk
Jij bent weg, maar dichterbij dan ooit

Liever vragen naar de langste weg
Dan een antwoord dat je stil doet staan
Liever zeggen wat ik zelden zeg
Dan verzwijgen dat ik door moet gaan

Ik hoef jou niets te vertellen
Wat ik niet al had gezegd
Met mijn mond of met mijn ogen
Voor altijd

Wie legt me uit hoe alles werkt
Hoe groot het gat is tussen nu en nooit
En hoe het komt dat ik nu merk
Jij bent weg, maar dichterbij dan ooit

Liever lachen om wat is geweest
Dan iets vrezen wat nog komt, misschien
Liever houden van een grote geest
Dan iets haten wat je niet kunt zien

Ik hoef jou niets uit te leggen
Het ligt hier open tussenin
En ik maak een laatste buiging
Voor altijd

Wie legt me uit hoe alles werkt
Hoe groot het gat is tussen nu en nooit
En hoe het komt dat ik nu merk
Jij bent weg, maar dichterbij dan ooit"
1818,1819,Atmosphere,Joy Division,1979,"Walk in silence
Don't walk away
In silence
See the danger
Always danger
Endless talking
Life rebuilding
Don't walk away

Walk in silence
Don't turn away
In silence
Your confusion
My illusion
Worn like a mask of self-hate
Confronts and then dies
Don't walk away

People like you
Find it easy
Aching to see
Walking on air
Hunting by the rivers through the streets
Every corner abandoned too soon
Set down with due care
Don't walk away
In silence
Don't walk away"

That Monday evening you would still be here with me

Monday, Monday, can't trust that day
Monday, Monday, sometimes it just turns out that way
Oh Monday morning, you gave me no warnin' of what was to be
Oh Monday, Monday, how could you leave and not take me

Every other day, every other day
Every other day of the week is fine, yeah
But whenever Monday comes, but whenever Monday comes
You can find me cryin' all of the time

What do I do to make you want me
What have I got to do to be heard
What do I say when it's all over
Sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad (so sad), so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd

That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love

The next thing I felt was you
Holding me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever

I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song

Filled my heart with your bliss
Gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone

Then you put your charms around me
I can't resist this sweet surrender
Oh, my nights are warm and tender

We stare into each other's eyes
And what we see is no surprise
Got a feeling most with treasure
And a love so deep we cannot measure!

(Ain't nobody) Nobody (Loves me better), does make me feel this way
Makes me happy, makes me feel this way) This way

And I Watch her slipping away
But I know I'll be

Hunting high and low
High
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to
Hunting high and low
High
There's no end to the lengths I'll go

To find her again
Upon this my dreams are depending
Through the dark
I sense the pounding of her heart
Next to mine
She's the sweetest love I could find
So I guess I'll be

Hunting high and low
High
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to
High and Low

Do you know what it means to love you

I'm hunting high and low
And now she's telling me she's got to go away

Watch me tearing myself to pieces

She makes up
She takes her time
And doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one

You need her
And yet you don't believe her
When she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

She doesn't need him

And that, you know, children are the only ones who blush
And that life is just to die

Oh, they wouldn't turn around and break it
And anyone who's ever played a part
Oh, they wouldn't turn around and hate it

Well, she was just seventeen
If you know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another
When I saw her standing there?

Well, she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long
I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another
When I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Whoa, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another
When I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh, we danced through the night

And the shadows come to stay

And I can't wait to see you again
So I can hold you in my arms

Is this love that I'm feeling?
Is this the love that I've been searching for?
Is this love (is this love?) or am I dreaming?
This must be love
'Cause it's really got a hold on me
A hold on me

Is this love that I'm feeling?
Is this the love that I've been searching for?
Is this love (is this love?) or am I dreaming?
Is this the love that I've been searching for?

Is this love (is this love?) or am I dreaming?

Effortlessly, you appear
Sound of the thunder
Reverberate in your ears
This is a slow dance
This is the chance to transform
Pause for the silence
Inhabit the calm of the storm

This is your ocean, an ocean of night
This is the notion, your ocean of night
This is your ocean, an ocean of night
This is the notion, your ocean of night

Love is a feeling
Buried with me in the yard
Gaze at the skyline
Under the ocean of stars
This is your slow dance
And this is your chance to transform
Lost to a moment
The moment you confront the storm

This is your ocean, an ocean of night
This is the notion, your ocean of night
This is your ocean, an ocean of night
This is the notion, your ocean of night

So you can hold back the fire

Lost and lonely every way
Got the flats all around me sky up above
Yes I need a little water of love

I've been too long lonely and my heart feels pain
Crying out for some soothing rain
I believe I have taken enough
Yes I need a little water of love

Water of love deep in the ground
But there ain't no water here to be found
Some day baby when the river runs free
It's gonna carry that water of love to me

There's a bird up in a tree sitting up high
Just a-waiting for me to die
If I don't get some water soon
I'll be dead and gone in the afternoon

Water of love deep in the ground
But there ain't no water here to be found
Some day baby when the river runs free
It's gonna carry that water of love to me

Once I had a woman I could call my own
Once I had a woman now my woman she gone
Once there was a river now there's a stone
You know it's evil when you're living alone

Water of love deep in the ground
But there ain't no water here to be found
Some day baby when the river runs free
It's gonna carry that water of love to me

(Carry that) water of love deep in the ground
But there ain't no water here to be found
Some day baby when the river runs free
It's gonna carry that water of love to me"

Wonders how you manage to feed the rest

See how they run

My time has come

I might leave
Leave behind

Wait in the fire

Alsof er iets opengaat
Iets wat er nog niet was
En dan denk ik, nee, dan weet ik
Ook al is het nog maar klein:
Het staat in steen gehouwen
Ik moet nergens anders zijn

Ze kijkt heel lang naar de wolken
En dan kijkt ze naar mij
Alsof ze nu iets nieuws ziet
Alsof er iets aan haar verschijnt
En dan lacht ze, dan straalt ze
Niemand hier is vrij
Ik kan maar niet begrijpen
Hoe zij zo zichzelf kan zijn

Open je ogen voor mij
Loop je geluk niet voorbij

Er staat nooit iets in de sterren
Wat een mens niet goed verstaat
Alsof elke vorm van uitleg
Het veel te moeilijk maakt
Maar je voelt het, en je ziet het
En je weet dat het zo is
En je kunt niet meer begrijpen
Dat je nooit iets hebt gemist

Open je ogen voor mij
Loop je geluk niet voorbij
Open je ogen voor mij
Loop je geluk niet voorbij

Niets bijzonders
Heel eenvoudig
Het gebeurt de hele tijd
Toch een donderslag
Bij heldere hemel
Want vandaag gebeurt het mij

Open je ogen voor mij
Loop je geluk niet voorbij
Open je ogen voor mij
Loop je geluk niet voorbij

De-donde vengo despues del viaje y que abrazo mi amada)

That the old songs are the best
Then she's up and rock 'n' rollin' with the rest

In a buggy you have made?

It's paved
With miles of the unknown

Whatever seems to be your destination
Take life the way it comes
Take life the way it is

Horizon in the distance
So close and yet so far away

You shouldn't be surprised when on arrival
The dream has flown away
And fears not here to stay

The road ahead never gives away a promise
The road ahead is a highway or a dead end street
A dead end street

Raindrops on your windscreen
They fall
From heaven or from hell

You drive into the light
Or into darkness
Uncertainty as your guide

The road ahead never gives away a promise
The road ahead is a highway or a dead end street
Oho, the road ahead never answers any questions

And nothing is sure along the way
Not even tomorrow
With miles of the unknown
Ahead of you

The road ahead is empty
It's paved
With miles of the unknown

Whatever seems to be your destination

Take life the way it is"

Find out what I'm made of
The nights I stayed up
Counting stars and fighting sleep

Let it wash over me
Ready to lose my feet
Take me on to the place where one reviews life's mystery
Steady on down the line
Lose every sense of time
Take it all in and wake up that small part of me
Day to day I'm blind to see
And find how far
To go

Everybody got their reason
Everybody got their way
We're just catching and releasing
What builds up throughout the day

It gets into your body
And it flows right through your blood
We can tell eachother secrets
And remember how to love

There's a place I'm going
No one knows me
If I breathe real slowly
Let it out and let it in
They can be terrifying
To be slowly dying
Also clarifying
The end where we begin

So let it wash over me
I'm ready to lose my feet
Take me on to the place where one reviews life's mystery
Steady on down the line
Lose every sense of time
Take it all in and wake up that small part of me
Day to day I'm blind to see
And find how far
To go

Everybody got their way

Everybody got their reason
Everybody got their way
We're just catching and releasing
What builds up throughout the day

And it gets into your body
And it flows right through your blood
We can tell eachother secrets
And remember how to love"

1888,1889,If I Could Turn Back Time,Cher,1989,"If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you and you'd stay

I don't know why I did the things I did
I don't know why I said the things I said
Pride's like a knife it can cut deep inside
Words are like weapons they wound sometimes

I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't wanna let you go
I know I made you cry, but baby

If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
And you'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give them all to you
Then you'd love me, love me
Like you used to do

If I could turn back time
My world was shattered, I was torn apart
You took a knife and drove it deep in my heart
You walked out that door, I swore that I didn't care
But I lost everything darlin', then and there

Too strong to tell you I was sorry
Too proud to tell you I was wrong
I know that I was blind, and darling

If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
And you'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give them all to you
Then you'd love me, love me
Like you used to do

Ooh

If I could turn back time
If I could turn back time
If I could turn back time
Ooh baby

I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't want to see you go
I know I made you cry

But if I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
If I could reach the stars
I'd give them all to you
Then you'd love me, love me
Like you used to do

If I could turn back time (turn back time)
If I could find a way (find a way)
Then baby, maybe, maybe
You'd stay

Reach the stars
If I could reach the stars"
1889,1890,Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,Santa Esmeralda,1977,"Baby, do you understand me now
Sometimes I feel a little mad
Well don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel
When things go wrong I seem to be bad

'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy, I want you to know
That I never meant to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I got my share
And that's one thing I never meant to do
'Cause I love you

Baby, don't you know I'm just human
And I've got thoughts like any other man
And sometimes I feel myself alone, regretting
Some foolish thing, some foolish thing I've done

Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And sometimes it seems that all I have to do is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good

That I've never meant to take it out on you

1890,1891,To Love Somebody,Bee Gees,1967,"There's a light, a certain kind of light
That never shone on me
I want my life to be
Lived with you, lived with you
There's a way, everybody say
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
If I ain't got you, ain't got you

Baby, you don't know what it's like
Baby, you don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

In my brain I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
And I'm blind, so, so, so very blind
I'm a man, can't you see what I am?
I live and I breathe for you
But what good does it do
If I ain't got you, ain't got you

Baby, you don't know what it's like

1891,1892,Weekend Love,Golden Earring,1979,"The sooner it will be the better
Gonna have to see her right away
It's been a long time since the day I met her
I can't handle being without her one more day
Gonna get the feeling that I'm going insane
Feel so stupid using these old cliches
You better hurry up Baby, I ain't lying
We're down to nothing but a waste of time
Still remember everything she said
Make no promises, make no debts
All I want is your one day weekend love
She nips her wine without a flinching
She's in control of it all the way
Looks so good, pretending that she's listening
By the time I fall asleep, she's gone away
She's got no mercy on a jealous heart
And she said it all right from the start
Make no problems, make no debts
But I love that lady, I got to confess

I want more than just a one day weekend love
I want more than just a one day weekend love
All she wants is just my one day weekend love
The sooner it will be the better
Gonna have to see her right away
It's been a week now since she's been around here
I can't handle being without her one more day
Honey, get the feeling that I'm going insane
Feel so stupid using these old cliches
She's got no mercy on a jealous heart
And she said it all right from the start
Make no promises, make no debts
But I love that lady, I got to confess

I want more than just a one day weekend love
I want more than just a one day weekend love
All she wants is just my one day weekend love

1892,1893,That Was Yesterday,Foreigner,1985,"I thought I knew you well
But all this time I could never tell
I let you get away
Haunts me every night and every day
You were the only one
The only friend that I counted on
How could I watch you walk away?
I'd give anything to have you here today
But now I stand alone with my pride
And dream that you're still by my side

But that was yesterday
I had the world in my hands
But it's not the end of my world
It's just a slight change of plans
That was yesterday
But today life goes on
No more hiding in yesterday
'Cause yesterday's gone
Ooh...

Love, my love I gave it all
Thought I saw the light when I heard you call
Life that we both could share
Has deserted me, left me in despair
But now I stand alone with my pride
Fighting back the tears I never let myself cry

But that was yesterday
Love was torn from my hands
But it's not the end of my world
It's just a little hard to understand
That was yesterday
But today life goes on
You won't find me in yesterday's world
Now yesterday's gone

Goodbye yesterday
Now it's over and done
Still I hope somewhere deep in your heart
Yesterday will live on
Ooh..."
1893,1894,New York Minute,Don Henley,1989,"Harry got up, dressed all in black
Went down to the station, and he never came back
They found his clothing scattered somewhere down the track
And he won't be down on Wall Street in the morning now

He had a home, love of a girl
But men get lost sometimes as years unfurl
One day, he crossed some line, and he was too much in this world
But I guess it doesn't matter anymore

In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute, things can get pretty strange
In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute

Lying here in the darkness, I hear the sirens wail
Somebody going to emergency, somebody's going to jail
You find somebody to love in this world, you better hang on tooth and nail
The wolf is always at the door

In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute, things can get a little strange
In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute

And in these days, darkness falls early
And people rush home to the ones they love
You'd better take a fool's advice than take care of your own
One day they're here, next day they're gone

Pulled my coat around my shoulders, took a walk down through the park
Leaves were falling around me, groaning city in the gathering dark
On some solitary rock, a desperate lover left his mark
""Baby, I've changed, please come back""

What the head makes cloudy, the heart makes very clear
I know the days were so much brighter in the time when she was here
I know that somebody somewhere can make these dark clouds disappear
But until that day, I have to believe, I believe, I believe

In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute, you can get out of the rain
In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York, New York minute today"

I'm not like others, this needs to go slow

Visions to make and gold dust to find
It's not you, it's definitely me
Got dreams to believe in and bright lights to see
No spark, startin' to doubt
I've got the feeling that this won't work out

I'm diggin'
Don't want you by my side
Me and my records all alone feels right
Well, I'm diggin'

Flicking through vinyl and feeding the rush
I dig for that one and I open the haunt
It's takin' all day from the back to the front

Sorry baby I'm gone diggin'

To find gold need plenty of souls
And everyone needs their separate goals

They have the flames that light up my fire
Although already sold
But it doesn't mean the story's untold

With no more angry words to say can come alive
Get into a car and drive
To the other side

Into the night
Into the light
You babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light

Are young but getting old before our time
We'll leave the TV and the radio behind

Steppin' out tonight

Can dress in pink and blue just like a child
And in a yellow taxi turn to me and smile
We'll be there in just a while

Talking on his phone again to someone who tells him that his balance is low
He's got nowhere to go
He's on his own again

Rock chick of the century is acting like she used to be
Dancing like there's no-one there before she never seemed to care
Now she wouldn't dare
It's so rock and roll to be alone

And say: ""I wish I was something more""
And they'll meet one day far away

Mrs. Black and White, she's never seen a shade of grey
Always something on her mind, every single day

Free so he can see

She'll say: ""I wish I knew you, I wish I loved you
Before I was his bride""

And you dance like Zizi Jeanmaire
Your clothes are all made by Balmain
And there's diamonds and pearls in your hair, yes, there are

You live in a fancy apartment
Off the Boulevard St. Michel
Where you keep your Rolling Stones records
And a friend of Sacha Distel, yes, you do

But where do you go to, my lovely
When you're alone in your bed?
Tell me the thoughts that surround you
I want to look inside your head, yes, I do

I've seen all your qualifications
You got from the Sorbonne
And the painting you stole from Picasso
Your loveliness goes on and on, yes, it does

When you go on your summer vacation
You go to Juan-les-Pins
With your carefully designed topless swimsuit
You get an even suntan, on your back and on your legs

And when the snow falls, you're found in St. Moritz
With the others of the jet set
And you sip your Napoleon brandy
But you never get your lips wet, no, you don't

But where do you go to, my lovely
When you're alone in your bed?
Won't you tell me the thoughts that surround you?
I want to look inside your head, yes, I do

Your name, it is heard in high places
You know the Aga Khan
He sent you a racehorse for Christmas
And you keep it just for fun, for a laugh, ha-ha-ha

They say that when you get married
It'll be to a millionaire
But they don't realize where you came from
And I wonder if they really care, or give a damn

Where do you go to, my lovely
When you're alone in your bed?
Tell me the thoughts that surround you
I want to look inside your head, yes, I do

I remember the back streets of Naples
Two children begging in rags
Both touched with a burning ambition
To shake off their lowly brown tags, they try

So look into my face, Marie-Claire
And remember just who you are
Then go and forget me forever
But I know you still bear the scar deep inside, yes, you do

I know where you go to, my lovely
When you're alone in your bed
I know the thoughts that surround you
'Cause I can look inside your head

And all we gotta do is hold up our end
Here, stuff this in your pocket, it'll look like you're carrying a friend
And remember, just don't smile
Change your shirt, 'cause tonight we got style

Well, Cherry says she's gonna walk
'Cause she found out I took her radio and hocked it
But Eddie, man, she don't understand
That two grand's practically sitting here in my pocket

And tonight's gonna be everything that I said
And when I walk through that door, I'm just gonna throw that money on the bed
She'll see this time I wasn't just talking
Then I'm gonna go out walking

Hey Eddie, can you catch us a ride?"

And sing whatever song you wanted me to
I give you back my voice from the womb

She'll be there when you hit the ground

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright, it's alright, alright
She moves in mysterious ways, oh

Johnny, take a dive with your sister in the rain
Let her talk about the things you can't explain
To touch is to heal, to hurt is to steal
If you want to kiss the sky, better learn how to kneel
On your knees, boy

She's the wave, she turns the tide
She sees the man inside the child

It's alright, it's alright, alright

It's alright, it's alright, alright
She moves in mysterious ways, yeah, oh, ah

Where you were held now by this love
While you could stand there
You could move on this moment
Follow this feeling

It only takes a camera to change her mind

She's going out to nightclubs drinking just champagne
And she has been checking nearly all the men
She's playing her game and you can hear them say
She is looking good, for beauty we will pay

We zullen doorgaan
Met het zweet op ons gezicht
Om alleen door te gaan
In een loopgraaf zonder licht

Telkens als we stil staan
Om weer door te gaan
Naakt in de orkaan

1919,1920,On The Border,Al Stewart,1977,"The fishing boats go out across the evening water
Smuggling guns and arms across the Spanish border
The wind whips up the waves so loud
The ghost moon sails among the clouds
Turns the rifles into silver on the border

On my wall the colours of the maps are running
From Africa the winds they talk of changes coming
The torches flare up in the night
The hand that sets the farms alight
Has spread the word to those who are waiting on the border

In the village where I grew up nothing seems the same
Still you never see the change from day to day
No one notices the customs slip away

Late last night the rain was knocking on my window
I moved across the darkened room and in the lamp glow
I thought I saw down in the street
The spirit of the century
Telling us that we're all standing on the border

In the islands where I grew up nothing seems the same
It's just the patterns that remain, an empty shell
But there's a strangeness in the air you feel too well

The fishing boats go out across the evening water
Smuggling guns and arms across the Spanish border
The wind whips up the waves so loud
The ghost moon sails among the clouds
Turns the rifles into silver on the border

On the border
On the border
On the border"

maar niemand komt dichtbij.
Misschien een uur,
misschien een nacht,
maar altijd blijft ze vrij.

Ohohohoh,
Totdat de ochtend
haar weer nieuwe kansen brengt.
Ohohohoh,
zal ze naast je staan...
Maar komt de morgen, zal ze gaan.

Vrij zijn,
Ze wil alleen maar vrij zijn.
Vrij zijn,
Liefde komt ooit.
Ze wil nu alleen maar,
Vrij zijn.
Onbezorgd en vrij zijn,
Liefde, liefde komt ooit...
Als ze niet meer vrij wil zijn.

Soms is ze bang en eenzaam,
en verlangt ze terug naar toen.
Geborgenheid en warmte,
en een vaderlijke zoen.
Maar ze wil het leven proeven,
zonder regels of gezag.
Juist al die dingen doen,
die bijna niemand anders mag

Ohohohoh,
Ze lacht de wereld uit,
en danst haar twijfels weg.
Ohohohoh,
Verliefd kijkt ze je aan,
Maar als je meer wilt zal ze gaan.

Vrij zijn,
Ze wil alleen maar vrij zijn.
Vrij zijn,
Liefde komt ooit.
Ze wil nu alleen maar,
Vrij zijn.
Onbezorgd en vrij zijn,
Liefde, liefde komt ooit.

En ze danst en ze lacht,
en ze gaat je te lijf.
Voor een uur,
voor een nacht,
maar denk niet dat ze blijft.

Ze wil nu alleen maar,

I hope I didn't wake you
But there's something that I just gotta say
Know you'd understand

Every time I tried to tell you
The words just came out wrong
So I'll have to say I love you in a song"
1924,1925,Birds,Chef'Special,2011,"I wish people would stop yelling and start listening
I wish birds would start talking and stop whistling

'Cause they know things that I don't know
Seven of them sitting on that wall
Staring at a lost soul and fly away
Too close to the window

I'm looking for some info
Can I trust Google Maps' photographs
What's flying like, are you free above
Is it really that worth, dreaming of

Or does that to get old like making love and alcohol
Or that track you wrote that made them all dance on the dancingfloor

But the dancing floor, it ends at four
When the dancing people have to go
And there is nothing left for you to roll, than home

Sun don't shine at night
Oh no, it don't
If only you would just open your eyes
I know I'm not alone
Is it alright if all these words don't mean nothing at all

I wish I was from a broken home
To explain the fact that I'm cold and alone
But my family is golden so it's probably just my own fault again

I wish those seven birds came back
And told me why this earth is wack
Cause it ain't sync what we deserve and get
Or do you think we should work on that

Sunday evening, Monday is eager to kill me like he did last week
I'm not the guy you think you need
I wish that you start missing me

And start distinguishing you and I
For we are the same and you're in my mind
But rain replaces snow and that's just pretty fucking lame"
1925,1926,Don't,Ed Sheeran,2014,"I met this girl late last year
She said ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away four months until our paths crossed again
She told me ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

For a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
But she was kissing him, how? I was confused about
She should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, but I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time, God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe"
1926,1927,Don't Look Back,Boston,1978,"Don't look back a new day is breakin'
It's been too long since I felt this way
I don't mind where I get taken
The road is callin' today is the day

And I can see it took so long just to realize
I'm much too strong not to compromise
Now I see what I am is holding me down
I'll turn it around, oh, yes I will

I finally see the dawn arrivin'
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'

It's a bright horizon and I'm awake now
Oh I see myself in a brand new way
The sun is shinin', the clouds are breakin'
‘Cause I can't lose now there's no game to play

I can tell there's no more time left to criticize
I've seen what I could not recognize
Everything in my life was leading me on
But I can be strong, oh, yes I can

I finally see the dawn arrivin'
I see beyond the road I'm drivin'
Far away and left behind, left behind

Oh the sun is shinin'
And I'm on that road

Don't look back a new day is breakin'
It's been too long since I felt this way
I don't mind where I get taken
The road is callin' today is the day

And I can see it took so long just to realize
I'm much too strong not to compromise
Now I see what I am is holding me down

1927,1928,Song Of The Marching Children,Earth & Fire,1971,"Part 1: Theme of the Marching Children

Part 2: Opening of the seal

Part 3: Childhood

Watching through the broken seal
I saw the tree of life, forever
All the branches fully green
Bearing human fruit, forever

You're ignoring to what you'll turn out to be
You'll once be sewing and gathering frequently
That's what you'll turn out to be

Watching through the broken seal
I saw marching children, and children
At the church nearby the gate
A preacher read his sermon for children

You're ignoring where the hell you're going to
God bless you for what the world is going to do
For what the world is going into

Why can't we go
Over the untouched road
Is it too winding
Flanked by reflections of time
Go and experience
Learn the human destiny
Happiness and sadness
Posts of your lifetime

Part 4: Affliction

Children's eyes fixing upon the gate to heaven
Predestinated for minority
Into the underworld the others tumbling down
Tortured by terrestrial vexations

Part 5: Damnation

A long procession
Hearing the black knight's thoughts
I have been watching you
Your conduct in life was in vain
Cross the waters of death
With their silent borders
Then you'll see
Your waiting graves

Part 6: Purification

When will be the crack of doom?
Is it tomorrow?

Is it tomorrow?

A laurel wreath for the future graves
Of the marching children

A laurel wreath for the future graves
Of the marching children

In my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean
Finally lovers know no shame

Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn around and say

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching, I keep waiting
Still anticipating love
Never hesitating
To become the fated ones

Turning and returning
To some secret place to find
Watching in slow motion
As you turn to me and say

My love
Take my breath away

Through the hourglass I saw you
In time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today
I am unafraid

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching every motion
In this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion
Somewhere there's a love in flames

Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn my way and say

Take my breath away

No, I just can't pretend

Wanna feel it again

Some for worse and some for better
But through it all we've come so far
Già... come vedi
Io sto ancora in piedi perché

Sono umani tutti i sogni miei, o yeah
Con le mani io li prenderei, sì perché...
What is life without a dream to hold?
Take my hand and never let me go

It's part of life together
But what future does it hold?
Sono cose della vita
Ma la vita poi dov'è?
Dov'è? Dov'è? Dov'è?

Yes, you know it's true
I just can't stop thinking of you
Questa notte che passa piano accanto a me
Cerco di affrontarla, afferrarla
If our hearts miss a beat
Or get lost like a ship at sea
I want to remember, I can never forget

Can't stop thinking of you

Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

Well, she used to run around with every man in town
She spent all my money, playing her high class game
She put me out, it was a pity how I cried
Tables turn and now her turn to cry

Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now, yeah

Well, I used to wake the morning, get my breakfast in bed
When I'd gotten worried, she'd ease my aching head
But now she's here and there with every man in town
Still trying to take me for that same old clown

1943,1944,No Surrender,Kane,2009,"I was up, I was down,
I felt almost everything.
I was lost, been around,
Still no hardly anything
Get my feet on the ground
And the heart of everything (It's just the way that I want it)
It's just the way that I want it

Like a shark, for the bait.
You have been always waiting there.
Everytime, just too late.
Now at last you're standing there
What a fool what a shame
And the heart of everything (It's just the way that I want it)
It's just the way that I want it

Tonight's tonight
Time to leave the pressure behind
There's no surrender, no

In the heart, at the root,
There's always something now.

In disguise, understood,
And the blame for someone else,
The time I will find
Was the heart of everything (It's just the way that I want it)
It's just the way that I want it

I don't know why
I guess it's just a matter of time
But there's no surrender, no, no surrender.

It's just the way that I want it

Tonight's tonight
Time to leave the pressure behind
There's no surrender, no
There's no surrender, no
There's no surrender, no surrender

I was up, I was down"
1944,1945,Forbidden Colours,Ryuichi Sakamoto & David Sylvian,1984,"The wounds on your hands never seem to heal
I thought all I needed was to believe

Here am I, a lifetime away from you
The blood of Christ, or the beat of my heart
My love wears forbidden colours
My life believes

Senseless years thunder by
Millions are willing to give their lives for you
Does nothing live on?

Learning to cope with feelings aroused in me
My hands in the soil, buried inside of myself
My love wears forbidden colours
My life believes in you once again

I'll go walking in circles
While doubting the very ground beneath me
Trying to show unquestioning faith in everything
Here am I, a lifetime away from you
The blood of Christ, or a change of heart

My love wears forbidden colours
My life believes
My love wears forbidden colours
My life believes in you once again"

Watching through my fingers

One ear out the other
Burning bright right till the end
Now you'll be missing from the photographs
Missing from the photographs

Watching through my fingers...
Watching through my fingers...

In my thoughts you're far away
And you are whistling a melody
Whistling a melody
Crystallizing clear as day,
Oh I can picture you so easily
Picture you so easily

What's gonna be left of the world
If you're not in it
What's gonna be left of the world oh

Every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more!
Every stumble and each misfire
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more!

Watching through my fingers
Watching through my fingers

Caught off guard by your favorite song
I'll be dancing at a funeral,
Dancing at a funeral
Sleeping in the clothes you love
It's such a shame we had to see them burn
Shame we had to see them burn

What's gonna be left of the world
If you're not in it
What's gonna be left of the world oh

Every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
Every stumble and each misfire
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more

You might have to excuse me
I've lost control of all my senses
And you might have to excuse me
I've lost control of all my words
So get drunk, call me a fool, put me in my place,
Put me in my place
Pick me up, up off the floor, put me in my place,
Put me in my place

Every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
Every stumble and each misfire
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more

I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more..."

Echoed voices in the night
She's a restless spirit on an endless flight

Woo hoo witchy woman
See how high she flies
Woo hoo witchy woman
She got the moon in her eye

She held me spellbound in the night
Dancing shadows and firelight
Crazy laughter in another room
And she drove herself to madness with a silver spoon

Woo hoo witchy woman, see how high she flies
Woo hoo witchy woman, she got the moon in her eye

Well I know you want a lover
Let me tell you brother, she's been sleeping in the Devil's bed
There's some rumors going round, someone's underground
She can rock you in the nighttime till your skin turns red

I remember when you couldn't wait to love me 
Used to hate to leave me 
Now after loving me late at night 

When it's good for you, babe 
And you're feeling all right 

When you just roll over and turn out the light... 
And you don't bring me flowers anymore 

It used to be so natural 

It used to be...

To talk about forever 

Mmm... 

But used-to-bes don't count anymore 
They just lay on the floor 
Till we sweep them away 

And baby I remember all the things you taught me 

I learned how to laugh and I learned how to cry 

Well, I learned how to love and I learned how to lie 

So you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye 

So you think I could learn how to tell you goodbye

Morning, just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized
How happy you made me, oh Mandy

Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

I'm standing on the edge of time
I've walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world
Of uphill climbing
The tears are in my eyes
And nothing is rhyming, oh Mandy

Well, you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well, you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

Yesterday's a dream
I face the morning
Crying on the breeze
The pain is calling, oh Mandy

To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes

To be hated
To be fated
To telling only lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings
Like I do
And I blame you

No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain and woe
Can show through

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

When my fist clenches, crack it open
Before I use it and lose my cool
When I smile, tell me some bad news
Before I laugh and act like a fool

And if I swallow anything evil
Put your finger down my throat
And if I shiver, please give me a blanket
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat

No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man

Leaving only ash-filled ashtrays
And the lipstick, unmade bed
The mirror, on reflection
Has climbed back upon the wall
For the floor she found descended
And the ceiling was too tall

Your trouser cuffs are dirty
And your shoes are laced up wrong
You'd better take off your Homburg
'Cause your overcoat is too long

Town clock in the market square
Stands waiting for the hour
When its hands they both turn backward
And on meeting will devour
Both themselves and also any fool
Who dares to tell the time
And the sun and moon will shadow
And the signpost cease to sign

Your trouser cuffs are dirty
And your shoes are laced up wrong

Maybe he'll look around himself and say
Guess it's time for the Judgement day

He'll either say I'm pleased where man has been
Or tear it down and start again, woah woah

In the year 9595
I'm kinda wondering if man is gonna be alive
He's taken everything this old earth can give
And he ain't put back nothing, woah woah

Now it's been 10,000 years
Man has cried a billion tears
For what he never knew
Now man's reign is through

So very far away

The things they really feel inside
I simply need you to need me
Can't you see

Once I hoped to be
Your lover and your friend
But it turned into a game
I won't play no more
I believe I'm right
When I say you loved me too
It just can't go on

The things they really feel inside

To show you how I feel

And done and felt about each other
Oh babe, have mercy
Don't let the past
Remind us of what we are not now

I'm going to fly away
What have I got to lose?
Will you come see me
Thursdays and Saturdays?
What have you got to lose?

Chestnut brown canary
Ruby throated sparrow
Sing the song, don't be long
Thrill me to the marrow

Voices of the angels
Ring around the moonlight
Asking me, said she so free
How can you catch the sparrow?

Where no one notices the contrast of white on white
And in between the moon and you, angels get a better view
Of the crumbling difference between wrong and right
Well I walk in the air between the rain
Through myself and back again, where? I don't know
Maria says she's dying, through the door I hear her crying
Why? I don't know

Round here, we always stand up straight
Round here, something radiates

Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
And she walked along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus
She parks her car outside of my house and takes her clothes off
Says she's close to understanding Jesus
And she knows she's more than just a little misunderstood
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous

Round here, we're carving out our names
Round here, we all look the same
Round here, we talk just like lions
But we sacrifice like lambs
Round here, she's slipping though my hands

Oh, sleeping children better run like the wind
Out of the lightning dream
Mama's little baby better get herself in
Out of the lightning

She says, it's only in my head
She says, shhh, I know, it's only in my head
But the girl on the car in the parking lot
Says, man, you should try to take a shot
Can't you see my walls are crumbling?
Then she looks up at the building
Says she's thinking of jumping
She says she's tired of life
She must be tired of something

Round here, she's always on my mind
Round here, hey man, I got lots of time
Round here, we're never sent to bed early
And nobody makes us wait
Round here, we stay up very, very, very, very late

I... I can't see nothing, nothing, round here
Oh, you catch me if I'm falling
You catch me if I'm falling
You catch me 'cause I'm falling down on you
I said I'm under the gun, round here
Oh man, I said I'm under the gun, round here
And I can't see nothing, nothing, round here"

She knew exactly what to do
A pseudonym to fool him
She couldn't have made a worst move

She sent him scented letters
And he received them with a strange delight
Just like his wife
But how she was before the tears
And how she was before the years flew by
And how she was when she was beautiful
She signed the letter

So she arranged a place to go
To see if he
Would fall for her incognito
And when he laid eyes on her
He got the feeling they had met before
Uncanny how she
Reminds him of his little lady
Capacity to give him all he needs
Just like his wife before she freezed on him
Just like his wife when she was beautiful
He shouted out

Give me your hand and I'll hold it

Behind the tears, inside the lies
A thousand slowly dying sunsets

1965,1966,Say You Won't Let Go,James Arthur,2016,"I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old

Doesn't matter to me

And do you, do you, do you, do you?
Know what you're doing, doing to me?
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby!

Due to lack of interest
Tomorrow is cancelled
Let the clocks be reset
And the pendulums held
'Cause there's nothing at all
Except the space in between
Finding out what you're called
And repeating your name

Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby!
And do you, do you, do you, do you?
Know what you're doing doing to me?

Now you know how happy I can be
Oh and our good time starts and end without dollar one to spend

However long I stay, I will always love you

1969,1970,As,Stevie Wonder,1976,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
Do know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Always
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Always
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Always
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

Did you know that true love asks for nothing?
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day?

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living, but tomorrow
Could make me the past, but that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Always
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Always
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Always
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Did you know you're loved by somebody?
Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left
Always
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
I'll be lovin' you forever
Until dear mother nature says her work is through
Always
Until the day that you are me and I am you
Always
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Always

We all know, sometimes life's hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your life, times that and twice its double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed

So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this Earth a place sometimes called Hell
Change your words, into truths, and then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren and their great grandchildren will tell

I'll be loving you
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Loving you
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Loving you
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Loving you
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Be loving you
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Loving you
Until the trees and seas just up, up and fly away
Loving you
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Loving you
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Loving you
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left
Be loving you
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
Loving you
'Til Mother Nature, Mother Nature says her work is through
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
Loving you
Until the day that you are me and I am you
Now ain't that loving you?
Hey
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Ain't that loving you?
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
And I've got to say, always
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Always
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Always
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Always
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Always
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that is the day that are no more

Worn-out places, worn-out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
Their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head, I want to drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
'Cause I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very, very
Mad world
Mad world
Mad world
Mad world

Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday, happy birthday
To feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello, teacher, tell me, what's my lesson?
Look right through me, look right through me

And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
'Cause I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very, very
Mad world

If you come knockin' late at night
She'll let you in her mouth
If the words you say are right

If you pay the price
She'll let you deep inside
But there's a secret garden she hides

She'll let you in her car
To go drivin' round
She'll let you into the parts of herself
That'll bring you down

She'll let you in her heart
If you got a hammer and a vise
But into her secret garden, don't think twice

You've gone a million miles
How far'd you get
To that place where you can't remember
And you can't forget

She'll lead you down the path
There'll be tenderness in the air
She'll let you come just far enough
So you know she's really there

Then she'll look at you and smile
And her eyes will say
She's got a secret garden

Where everything you want
Where everything you need
Will always stay
A million miles away"

But now I've come back again
Why do I find it hard to write the next line?
Oh, I want the truth to be said

I know this much is true
I know this much is true

With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue
Dissolve the nerves that have just begun
Listening to Marvin (All night long)
This is the sound of my soul

Always slipping from my hands
Sand's a time of its own
Take your seaside arms and write the next line

Where people drown and people serve

Is only just light years to go

Me, my thoughts are flower strewn
Ocean storm, bayberry moon
I have got to leave to find my way

Watch the road and memorize
This life that passed before my eyes
Nothing is going my way

The ocean is the river's goal
A need to leave the water knows
We're closer now than light years to go

I have got to find the river
Bergamot and vetiver
Run through my head and fall away

Leave the road and memorize
This life that passed before my eyes
Nothing is going my way

There's no one left to take the lead
But I tell you and you can see
We're closer now than light years to go

Pick up here and chase the ride
The river empties to the tide
Fall into the ocean

The river to the ocean goes
A fortune for the undertow
None of this is going my way

There is nothing left to throw
Of Ginger, lemon, indigo
Coriander stem and rose of hay

Strength and courage overrides
The privileged and weary eyes
Of river poet search naiveté

Pick up here and chase the ride
The river empties to the tide
All of this is coming your way"

The radiator running dry
I've never been much of a gambler
And had a preference to fly

You said, forget about the airline
Let's take the car and save the fare
We blew a gasket on the Grapevine
And eighty dollars on repairs

All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard

Hot summer night in Sausalito
Can't stand the heat another mile
Let's drop a quarter in the meter
And hit the sidewalk for a while

I'll have a burger and a root beer
You feed the heap some multi-grade
A shot of premium to boot, dear
We'll get across the Golden Gate

All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard

Another mile or two to Frisco
Two hundred gallons from L.A
The engine's thumpin' like a disco
We ought to dump her in the bay

All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard

Cashin' all my checks, scrapin' out my bank
Spend it on a Rambler with a whirlpool in the tank
Look out over here, watch out over there
Can't afford a blowout 'cause we haven't got a spare

Maybe we can sleep in
I'll make you banana pancakes

But just maybe, hala ka ukulele
Mama made a baby
Really don't mind the practice

Rain all day
And I don't mind
The telephone is singing
Ringing it's too early
Don't pick it up
We don't need to we got everything
We need right here
And everything we need is enough
Just so easy
When the whole world fits inside of you're arms
Don't really need to pay attention to the alarm
Wake up slow, mmm mmm, wake up slow

Everywhere together
I know you'll count on me

But we're not alone
Your father and your sister
Are waiting patiently

And hold on to love
Soon you'll find the world at your feet
Take your time girl

And hold on to love

When the whole world's asleep
I imagine how you'll be in 2033
And it's all fine by me

Yesterday, I got so old
It made me want to cry

Go on, go on, just walk away
Go on, go on, your choice is made
Go on, go on, and disappear
Go on, go on, away from here

And I know I was wrong when I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her in between
Without you
Without you

Yesterday, I got so scared
I shivered like a child
Yesterday, away from you
It froze me deep inside

Come back, come back, don't walk away
Come back, come back, come back today
Come back, come back, why can't you see?
Come back, come back, come back to me

But what it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
Telling me I got to beware

I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?

There's battle lines being drawn
And nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speaking their minds
Getting so much resistance from behind

It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?

What a field day for the heat
A thousand people in the street
Singing songs and carrying signs
Mostly say, ""Hooray for our side""

It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?

Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line, the man come and take you away

We better stop, hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?

You better stop, hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look, what's going down?

You better stop, now, what's that sound?

Water in the milk
From a hole in the roof
Where the rain came through
What can you do, hmmm?

Tears from your little sister
Crying because she doesn't have 
A dress without a patch
For the party to go
But you know she'll get by

'Cause she's living in 
The love of the common people
Smiles from the heart
Of a family man

Daddy's gonna buy you
A dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
And she can

It's a good thing
You don't have a bus fare
It would fall through the hole
In your pocket and you'd lose it
In the snow on the ground
You got to walk into town
To find a job

Tryin' to keep your hands warm
When the hole in your shoe
Let the snow come through
And chill you to the bone
Somehow you'd better go home
Where it's warm

Where you can live in 
The love of the common people
Smile from the heart
Of a family man

Daddy's gonna buy you
A dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
And she can

Living on a dream ain't easy
But the closer the knit
The tighter the fit
And the chills stay away

'Cause we take 'em in stride
For family pride
You know that faith
Is in your foundation
With a whole lot of love
And a warm conversation
But don't forget to pray
It's makin' it strong
Where you belong

And we're living in 
The love of the common people
Smiles from the heart
Of a family man

Daddy's gonna buy you
A dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
And she can

Yes, we're living in
The love of the common people
Smile's from the heart
Of a family man

Daddy's gonna buy you
A dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can

Living in
The love of the common people
Smiles from the heart
Of a family man

Daddy's gonna buy you
A dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can

Smile's really hard
On a family man

Only thing about me is the way I walk
I can't dance, I can't sing

Everything.

Blue jeans sitting on the beach
Her dog's talking to me, but she's out of reach
She's got a body under that shirt
But all she wants to do is rub my face in the dirt

Only thing about me is the way I walk

Fat guy's talking to me trying to steal my blues
Thick smoke, see her smiling through

Wond'ring in the night

We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night, two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm, embracing dance away and

Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right
For strangers in the night

Love was just a glance away
A warm, embracing dance away

Ever since that night, we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever

To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch to getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

But now we're sleeping at the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore

I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

And I'll be me

Trying to fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
There's no force on earth
Could make me feel right, no

Whoa

Trying to push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
Think now's the time to let it slide

So come on let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me

Everything's that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall
Forget about me

From finding life out on my own

Stop this train

And go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in

But honestly, won't someone stop this train?

So scared of getting older
I'm only good at being young
So I play the numbers game
To find a way to say that life has just begun

Had a talk with my old man
Said ""Help me understand""
He said ""turn sixty-eight""
""You'll re-negotiate""

""Don't stop this train
Don't for a minute change the place you're in
And don't think I couldn't ever understand
I tried my hand
John, honestly we'll never stop this train""

Once in a while, when it's good
It'll feel like it should
And they're all still around
And you're still safe and sound

And you don't miss a thing
Till you cry when you're driving away in the dark
Singing
Stop this train

I want to get off
And go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't

Every tune, every tune"""
